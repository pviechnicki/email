The application period runs from May 16, 2018, through June 27, 2018. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 7526, the IRS will annually award up to $6,000,000 (unless otherwise provided by specific Congressional appropriation) to qualifying organizations, subject to the limitations set forth in the statute. For fiscal year 2018, Congress appropriated a total of $12,000,000 in federal funds for LITC grants. See Public Law 115-141. A qualifying organization may receive a matching grant of up to $100,000 per year for up to a three-year project period. Qualifying organizations that provide representation to low income taxpayers involved in a tax controversy with the IRS and educate individuals for whom English is a second language (ESL) about their rights and responsibilities under the IRC are eligible for a grant. An LITC must provide services for free or for no more than a nominal fee. Examples of qualifying organizations include (1) a clinical program at an accredited law, business, or accounting school whose students represent low income taxpayers in tax controversies with the IRS and (2) an organization exempt from tax under IRS section 501(a) whose employees and volunteers represent low income taxpayers in controversies with the IRS and may also make referrals to qualified volunteers to provide representation. In determining whether to award a grant, the IRS will consider a variety of factors, including: (1) The number of taxpayers who will be assisted by the organization, including the number of ESL taxpayers in that geographic area; (2) the existence of other LITCs assisting the same population of low income and ESL taxpayers; (3) the quality of the program offered by the organization, including the qualifications of its administrators and qualified representatives, and its record, if any, in providing representation services to low income taxpayers; (4) the quality of the application, including the reasonableness of the proposed budget; (5) the organization's compliance with all federal tax obligations (filing and payment); (6) the organization's compliance with all federal nontax monetary obligations (filing and payment); (7) whether debarment of suspension (31 CFR part 19) applies or whether the organization is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for a federal award; and (8) alternative funding sources available to the organization, including amounts received from other grants and contributors and the endowment and resources of the institution sponsoring the organization.",Notice,This document contains a notice that the IRS has made available the 2019 Grant Application Package and Guidelines (Publication 3319) for organizations interested in applying for a Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) matching grant for the 2019 grant...,DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,treasury-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/treasury-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/05/21/2018-10742/low-income-taxpayer-clinic-grant-program-availability-of-2019-grant-application-package,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-05-21/pdf/2018-10742.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-10742.pdf?1526647529,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/497.json,

This dependency of the United States on foreign sources creates a strategic vulnerability for both its economy and military to adverse foreign government action, natural disaster, and other events that can disrupt supply of these key minerals. Pursuant to Executive Order 13817 of December 20, 2017, ``A Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals,'' the Secretary of the Interior on February 16, 2018, presented a draft list of 35 mineral commodities deemed critical under the definition provided in the Executive Order. After considering the 453 public comments received, the Department of the Interior believes that the methodology used to draft the list remains valid and hereby finalizes the draft list of 35 critical minerals. The final list includes: Aluminum (bauxite), antimony, arsenic, barite, beryllium, bismuth, cesium, chromium, cobalt, fluorspar, gallium, germanium, graphite (natural), hafnium, helium, indium, lithium, magnesium, manganese, niobium, platinum group metals, potash, the rare earth elements group, rhenium, rubidium, scandium, strontium, tantalum, tellurium, tin, titanium, tungsten, uranium, vanadium, and zirconium. This list of critical minerals, while ``final,'' is not a permanent list, but will be dynamic and updated periodically to reflect current data on supply, demand, and concentration of production, as well as current policy priorities.

2018-10159,2018-05-14,54,Commerce Department,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"Notice of Approval for the Jobos Bay, Puerto Rico National Estuarine Research Reserve Management Plan Revision","Under applicable Federal regulations, notice is hereby given that the Stewardship Division, Office for Coastal Management, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce approves the revised Management Plan for Jobos Bay, Puerto Rico National Estuarine Research Reserve Management Plan. In accordance with applicable Federal regulations, the Jobos Bay Reserve revised its Management Plan, which will replace the plan previously approved in 2000. The revised Management Plan outlines the administrative structure; the research/monitoring, stewardship, education, and training programs of the Reserve; and the plans for future land acquisition and facility development to support Reserve operations. The Jobos Bay Reserve takes an integrated approach to management, linking research, education, coastal training, and stewardship functions. The Reserve has outlined how it will manage administration and its core program providing detailed actions that will enable it to accomplish specific goals and objectives. Since the last management plan, the reserve has: Developed core programs; expanded monitoring programs within Jobos Bay and its watershed; expanded its dorm, and remodeled the historic train depot and visitor center; conducted training workshops; implemented K-12 education programs; and built new and innovative partnerships with local, Commonwealth, and U.S. organizations and universities. On August 28, 2017, NOAA issued a notice of a thirty day public comment period for the Jobos Bay Reserve revised plan (82 FR 40752). Responses to the written and oral comments received, and an explanation of how comments were incorporated into the final revised plan, are available in Appendix 8 of the revised plan. Since the last management plan was approved in 2000, the Jobos Bay Reserve has acquired an additional 8233.9 acres of upland forest, salt flats and offshore cays. While the intent to include these into the boundaries of the management plan is acknowledged in this revised management plan, the actual inclusion of the properties will not be accomplished with the approval of the revised plan. Rather, a formal boundary expansion will be pursued as a separate action after this plan has been approved. All of the proposed additions are owned by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) and will be managed for long-term protection and conservation value. These parcels have high ecological value and will enhance the Reserve's ability to provide increased opportunities for research, education, and stewardship.

As a result of a biennial review of this system, the Department is updating this SORN to: Change the system of records name to Criminal History and Immigration Verification (CHIVe); add one new category of individuals to include individuals seeking approval from HHS to sponsor an unaccompanied alien child and/or other adult members of the potential sponsor's household; add one new category of records to include biometrics for potential sponsors of an unaccompanied alien child and/or other adult members of the potential sponsor's household; expand a category of records to include screening to verify or ascertain citizenship or immigration status, immigration history, and criminal history for sponsorship of unaccompanied alien children; add a new purpose of the system: To screen individuals to verify or ascertain citizenship or immigration status, immigration history, and criminal history to inform determinations regarding sponsorship of unaccompanied alien children who are in the care and custody of HHS; add a new routine use to describe how the DHS may share information from this system of records with HHS; modify routine use (E) and add routine use (F) to conform to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M- 17-12 ``Preparing for and Responding to a Breach of Personally Identifiable Information'' (Jan. 3, 2017); revise the records retention periods so that they align with the records schedule approved by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); and clarify that DHS may use information maintained in this system of records for other purposes consistent with its statutory authorities. Because this system will no longer cover information related to public tips, ICE is also updating the SORN to: Remove two categories of individuals; remove two categories of records; remove one routine use that allows DHS to disclose reports of suspicious activity, tips, potential violations of law, and other relevant information to external law enforcement agencies; and remove four purposes for the collection of information. Additionally, this notice includes non-substantive changes to simplify the formatting and text of the previously published notice. This modified system of records will be included in DHS's inventory of record systems. ICE will issue a new Privacy Act rulemaking, elsewhere in the Federal Register.",Notice,"In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to modify, rename, and reissue a current DHS U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) system of records titled, ``Department of Homeland Security...",DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,homeland-security-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/homeland-security-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/05/08/2018-09902/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-05-08/pdf/2018-09902.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-09902.pdf?1525697139,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/227.json,

Chapter 35), the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is forwarding an Information Collection Request (ICR) to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Our ICR describes the information we seek to collect from the public. Review and approval by OIRA ensures that we impose appropriate paperwork burdens. The RRB invites comments on the proposed collections of information to determine (1) the practical utility of the collections; (2) the accuracy of the estimated burden of the collections; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information that is the subject of collection; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of collections on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Comments to the RRB or OIRA must contain the OMB control number of the ICR. For proper consideration of your comments, it is best if the RRB and OIRA receive them within 30 days of the publication date. 1. Title and purpose of information collection: Appeal Under the Railroad Retirement and Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act; OMB 3220- 0007. Under Section 7(b)(3) of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA), and Section 5(c) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) any person aggrieved by a decision made by an office of the RRB on his or her application for an annuity or benefit under those Acts has the right to appeal to the RRB. This right is prescribed in 20 CFR 260 and 20 CFR 320. The notification letter, which is provided at the time of filing the original application, informs the applicant of such right. When an applicant protests a decision, the concerned RRB office reviews the entire file and any additional evidence submitted and sends the applicant a letter explaining the basis of the determination. The applicant is then notified that to protest further, they can appeal to the RRB's Bureau of Hearings and Appeals. The appeal process is prescribed in 20 CFR 260.5 and 260.9 and 20 CFR 320.12 and 320.38. To file a request for an appeal the applicant must complete Form HA-1, Appeal Under the Railroad Retirement Act or Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. The form asks the applicant to explain the basis for their request for an appeal and, if necessary, to describe any additional evidence they wish to submit in support of the appeal. Completion is voluntary, however, if the information is not provided the RRB cannot process the appeal. Previous Requests for Comments: The RRB has already published the initial 60-day notice (83 FR 7511 on February 21, 2018) required by 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2).

L. 104-13, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995), this notice announces the intention of BTS to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to approve a new data collection: Oil and Gas Industry Safety Data. In August 2013, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) and BTS signed an Interagency Agreement to develop and implement SafeOCS, a voluntary program for confidential reporting of `near misses' occurring on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Oil and Gas Industry Safety Data (ISD) program, is a component of BTS's SafeOCS data sharing framework, that provides a trusted, proactive means for the oil and gas industry to report sensitive and proprietary safety information, and to identify early warnings of safety problems and potential safety issues by uncovering hidden, at-risk conditions not previously exposed from analysis of reportable accidents and incidents. Companies participating in the ISD are voluntarily submitting safety data. There is no regulatory requirement to submit such data. The ISD identifies a broader range of data categories to ensure safe performance and appropriate risk management, which adds a learning component to assist the oil and gas industry in achieving improved safety performance. BTS will be the repository for the data, and will analyze and aggregate information proffered under this program, and publish reports providing identification of potential causal factors and trends or patterns before safety is compromised, and affording continuous improvement opportunities by focusing on repairing impediments to safety.",Notice,"In accordance with the requirements of section 3506(c)(2)(A) of Title 44 of the U.S. Code (Pub.

2018-09461,2018-05-04,268,Justice Department,Antitrust Division,Department of Justice's Initiative to Seek Termination of Legacy Antitrust Judgments,"This notice describes the Department of Justice's new initiative for seeking unilaterally to terminate ``legacy'' antitrust judgments. Legacy antitrust judgments are those judgments that do not include an express termination date and that a court has not terminated by an order. The vast majority of these judgments were entered before 1979, when the Division adopted the general practice of using sunset provisions to terminate a judgment automatically, usually 10 years after entry of the judgment. Nearly 1300 legacy judgments remain open on the books of the Antitrust Division, and nearly all of them likely remain open on the dockets of courts around the country. Many of these legacy judgments do not serve their original purpose of protecting competition. To eliminate the burden on defendants, courts, and the Division of complying with, overseeing, and enforcing outdated judgments, the Division has announced an initiative whereby it unilaterally will seek to terminate legacy judgments, as appropriate. The initiative provides for public notice and comment before the Division seeks to terminate a judgment. The Division has established a website to keep the public apprised of this initiative and its efforts to terminate outdated judgments: www.justice.gov/atr/ JudgmentTermination.",Notice,This notice describes the Department of Justice's new initiative for seeking unilaterally to terminate ``legacy'' antitrust judgments.

As part of the FCC's efforts, the agency consulted with a wide range of communities to determine the appropriate steps needed to enable the rapid and efficient deployment of next-generation wireless networks--or 5G-- throughout the United States. The Order focuses on ensuring the Commission's rules properly address the differences between large and small wireless facilities, and clarifies the treatment of small cell deployments. Specifically, the Order: Excludes small wireless facilities deployed on non-Tribal lands from National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review, concluding that these facilities are not ``undertakings'' or ``major Federal actions.'' Small wireless facilities deployments continue to be subject to currently applicable state and local government approval requirements. The Order also clarifies and makes improvements to the process for Tribal participation in section 106 historic preservation reviews for large wireless facilities where NHPA/NEPA review is still required; removes the requirement that applicants file Environmental Assessments solely due to the location of a proposed facility in a floodplain, as long as certain conditions are met; and establishes timeframes for the Commission to act on Environmental Assessments.

The purpose of the RMP is to manage commercial, recreational, ceremonial, and subsistence salmon fisheries potentially affecting the Puget Sound Chinook ESU within the marine and freshwater areas of Puget Sound, from the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca inward, including fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Pacific Salmon Commission's Fraser River Panel. In order for NMFS to make a positive determination under Limit 6 on the RMP, NMFS must conclude that the RMP's management framework is consistent with the criteria under Limit 6. Limit 6 applies to RMPs developed jointly by the States of Washington, Oregon and/or Idaho and the Tribes within the continuing jurisdiction of United States v. Washington or United States v. Oregon.

The temporary rule for emergency action (emergency rule), under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), implements the 2018 annual management measures for the West Coast ocean salmon fisheries for the area from the U.S./Canada border to Cape Falcon, OR, from May 1, 2018, through October 28, 2018. The emergency rule is required because allocation of coho harvest between recreational and commercial fisheries will not be consistent with the allocation schedule specified in the Pacific Coast Salmon Fishery Management Plan (FMP) in order to limit fishery impacts on Queets and Grays Harbor coho and meet conservation and management objectives. The fishery management measures for the area from Cape Falcon, OR, to the U.S./Mexico border are consistent with the FMP and are implemented through a final rule. Specific fishery management measures vary by fishery and by area. The measures establish fishing areas, seasons, quotas, legal gear, recreational fishing days and catch limits, possession and landing restrictions, and minimum lengths for salmon taken in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (3-200 nautical miles (nmi)) off Washington, Oregon, and California. The management measures are intended to prevent overfishing and to apportion the ocean harvest equitably among treaty Indian, non-treaty commercial, and recreational fisheries. The measures are also intended to allow a portion of the salmon runs to escape the ocean fisheries in order to provide for spawning escapement and inside fisheries (fisheries occurring in state internal waters).",Rule,"Through this final rule, NMFS establishes fishery management measures for the 2018 ocean salmon fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and California and the 2019 salmon seasons opening earlier than May 1, 2019.

On December 27, 2017, the Board, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), requested public comment for 60 days on a proposal to extend, with revision, the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks (FFIEC 002) and the Report of Assets and Liabilities of a Non-U.S. Branch that is Managed or Controlled by a U.S. Branch or Agency of a Foreign (Non-U.S.) Bank (FFIEC 002S), which are currently approved collections of information. The Board published this proposal on behalf of the agencies. The proposed revisions to these reports align with corresponding changes made to the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051). The Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income are commonly referred to as the Call Report. The proposed revisions to the FFIEC 002 and the FFIEC 002S delete or consolidate certain items, establish certain reporting thresholds, account for changes in the accounting for equity investments, and make instructional clarifications consistent with those previously made to or currently proposed for the Call Report instructions. The proposed revisions would result in an overall reduction in burden. The comment period for this proposal ended on February 26, 2018. The Board received two comments addressing the proposed changes.
