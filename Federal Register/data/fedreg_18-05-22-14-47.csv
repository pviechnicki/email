2018-06564,2018-04-03,174,Federal Housing Finance Agency,,Federal Housing Finance Board; Repeal of Federal Housing Finance Board Regulations,"The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is proposing to repeal two parts of the Federal Housing Finance Board (Finance Board) regulations, one of which defines terms used in Finance Board regulations and one of which describes the process by which the Finance Board conducted its monthly interest rate survey (MIRS). The definitions to be repealed are either obsolete or duplicate definitions that FHFA has previously adopted. The regulation relating to the MIRS has become outdated because it does not accurately describe the manner in which FHFA currently conducts the survey. Although FHFA intends to continue to conduct the MIRS in the same manner as it is doing presently, there is no need to carry over this provision into its own regulations. FHFA also is proposing to repeal a number of subchapters of the Finance Board regulations that it had previously reserved, but which no longer serve any purpose because they include no regulatory text.",Proposed Rule,"The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is proposing to repeal two parts of the Federal Housing Finance Board (Finance Board) regulations, one of which defines terms used in Finance Board regulations and one of which describes the process by which...",FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY,federal-housing-finance-agency,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/federal-housing-finance-agency,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/03/2018-06564/federal-housing-finance-board-repeal-of-federal-housing-finance-board-regulations,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-04-03/pdf/2018-06564.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-06564.pdf?1522673117,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/174.json,

The SIP revision revises the Commonwealth's maintenance plan emissions inventory and associated motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs), for years 2020 and 2030, to remove reliance on emissions reductions from the federal RFG program requirements, a program that the Commonwealth voluntarily opted into in 1995. The SIP revision also includes a non-interference demonstration evaluating whether removing reliance on the RFG requirements in the Northern Kentucky Area would interfere with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act). EPA is approving this SIP revision and the corresponding non-interference demonstration because EPA determined that the revision is consistent with the applicable provisions of the CAA.

Nielsen, directing her to implement for eligible Liberians a 12-month deferred enforced departure (DED) wind-down period and to provide for work authorization through March 31, 2019, upon which date DED will end. This 12-month transitional period of DED will allow impacted individuals to arrange for their departure from the United States. This Notice automatically extends DED-related employment authorization documents (EADs) that have a printed expiration date of March 31, 2018, for an additional 6 months through September 30, 2018, for eligible Liberians. This Notice also provides instructions for eligible Liberians on how to apply for the full 12-month period of employment authorization, through March 31, 2019. USCIS will issue new employment authorization documents (EADs) with a March 31, 2019 expiration date to eligible Liberians who are covered by DED under the Presidential Memorandum of March 27, 2018, and who apply for a new EAD. Given the timeframes involved with processing EAD applications, DHS recognizes that not all DED-eligible Liberians will receive new EADs before their current EADs expire on March 31, 2018. Accordingly, through this Notice, DHS also automatically extends the validity of DED-related EADs for 6 months, through September 30, 2018, and explains how Liberians covered under DED and their employers may determine which EADs are automatically extended and how this impacts the Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9) and E-Verify processes.",Notice,"On March 27, 2018, President Trump issued a memorandum to the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary), Kirstjen M.

2018-06292,2018-03-29,268,Justice Department,"Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Bureau",Bump-Stock-Type Devices,"The Department of Justice (Department) proposes to amend the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives regulations to clarify that ``bump fire'' stocks, slide-fire devices, and devices with certain similar characteristics (bump-stock-type devices) are ``machineguns'' as defined by the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) and the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), because such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger. Specifically, these devices convert an otherwise semiautomatic firearm into a machinegun by functioning as a self-acting or self-regulating mechanism that harnesses the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter. Hence, a semiautomatic firearm to which a bump-stock-type device is attached is able to produce automatic fire with a single pull of the trigger. With limited exceptions, primarily as to government agencies, the GCA makes it unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun unless it was lawfully possessed prior to the effective date of the statute. The bump-stock-type devices covered by this proposed rule were not in existence prior to the GCA's effective date, and therefore would fall within the prohibition on machineguns if this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) is implemented. Consequently, current possessors of these devices would be required to surrender them, destroy them, or otherwise render them permanently inoperable upon the effective date of the final rule.",Proposed Rule,"The Department of Justice (Department) proposes to amend the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives regulations to clarify that ``bump fire'' stocks, slide-fire devices, and devices with certain similar characteristics (bump-stock-type...",DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,justice-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/justice-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/29/2018-06292/bump-stock-type-devices,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-03-29/pdf/2018-06292.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-06292.pdf?1522263318,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/268.json,

RUS will publish on its website https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/notices- solicitation-applications-nosas the amount of funding received through the final appropriations act. Since the passage of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (2014 Farm Bill), RUS has only accepted applications according to discrete application windows as identified in notices published in the Federal Register. However, based on a review of the applications submitted since the implementation of the 2014 Farm Bill, RUS has determined that the use of application windows has not effectively supported the Agency's mission to finance improved broadband service in rural areas. As a result, RUS is accepting applications on a rolling basis throughout FY 2018. This will give RUS the ability to request additional information and modifications to a submitted application whenever necessary. Applications will be processed on a first come, first served basis. Every ninety (90) days, RUS will conduct an evaluation of the submitted applications. During the evaluation period, applications will be ranked based on the percentage of unserved households that the applicant proposes to serve.

2018-06033,2018-03-26,468,Small Business Administration,,Conforming Statutory Amendments and Technical Corrections to Small Business Government Contracting Regulations,"The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) is amending its regulations to incorporate a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 (NDAA 2018) and to update and provide several technical corrections to SBA's regulations. Specifically, the NDAA 2018 amended the Small Business Act by replacing fixed dollar amount thresholds with references to the micro-purchase and simplified acquisition thresholds. SBA is updating its regulations to conform to this new statutory language. SBA is also updating the sole source dollar amounts for the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVO) small business and the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business regulations. The thresholds for sole source contracting are contained in the Small Business Act, SBA's regulations, and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). These thresholds are updated in the FAR for inflation periodically, and therefore, over time, SBA's regulations and the FAR's numbers diverge. SBA is making this change to conform the thresholds contained in SBA's regulations to those in the FAR. This rule also allows indirect ownership by United States citizens in the HUBZone program to more accurately align with the underlying statutory authority. Finally, SBA is making several technical changes to address mistakes and typos made in previous rulemakings. For example, this final rule will update some cross-references that were not updated when a previous rulemaking changed numbering. Other changes made are for errors, grammar, syntax, and clarity.",Rule,The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) is amending its regulations to incorporate a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 (NDAA 2018) and to update and provide several technical corrections to SBA's regulations....,SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION,small-business-administration,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/small-business-administration,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/26/2018-06033/conforming-statutory-amendments-and-technical-corrections-to-small-business-government-contracting,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-03-26/pdf/2018-06033.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-06033.pdf?1521809125,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/468.json,

The Commission is undertaking this rulemaking in light of technological advances since the Commission last revised its rules governing internet disclaimers in 2006, and questions from the public about the application of those rules to internet communications. The Commission's goal is to promulgate a rule that in its text and interpretation recognizes the paramount importance of providing the public with the clearest disclosure of the payor or sponsor of these public communications on the internet. Both proposals are intended to give the American public easy access to information about the persons paying for and candidates authorizing these internet communications, pursuant to the Federal Election Campaign Act. Both proposals would continue to require disclaimers for certain internet communications, and both would allow certain internet communications to provide disclaimers through alternative technology. The proposals differ, however, in their approach. The Commission requests comment on all elements of both proposals. The two proposals need not be considered as fixed alternatives; commenters are encouraged to extract the best elements of each, or suggest improvements or alternatives, to help the Commission fashion the best possible rule.

To assist in this undertaking, FMCSA commissioned the U.S. Department of Transportation's John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe) to conduct a preliminary review of the FMCSRs to identify regulations that may relate to the development and safe introduction of ADS. The Agency requests comments on this report, including whether any of FMCSA's current safety regulations may hinder the testing and safe integration of ADS-equipped CMVs. Further, FMCSA requests comment on certain specific regulatory requirements that are likely to be affected by an increased integration of ADS-equipped CMVs. However, the Agency is not seeking comments on its financial responsibility requirements because they are not directly related to CMV technologies and because future insurance requirements will depend in part on the evolution of State tort law with respect to liability for the operation of ADS-equipped vehicles. In addition, to support FMCSA's effort to understand future impacts on the FMCSR's, FMCSA requests information, including from companies engaged in the design, development, testing, and integration of ADS-equipped CMVs into the fleet. Specifically, the Agency requests information about: The scenarios and environments where entities expect that ADS will soon be tested and integrated into CMVs operating on public roads or in interstate commerce; the operational design domains (ODD) in which these systems are being operated or would be tested and eventually deployed; and, measures they believe are required to ensure the protection of any proprietary or confidential business information they intend to share with the Agency.",Proposed Rule,"FMCSA requests public comments on existing Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) that may need to be updated, modified, or eliminated to facilitate the safe introduction of automated driving systems (ADS) equipped commercial motor vehicles...",DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION,transportation-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/transportation-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/26/2018-05788/request-for-comments-concerning-federal-motor-carrier-safety-regulations-fmcsrs-which-may-be-a,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-03-26/pdf/2018-05788.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-05788.pdf?1521809116,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/492.json,

On January 25, 2018, OTLA received the Submission from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and Mexico's National Workers Union. It alleges that the introduction of reforms to the Federal Labor Law of Mexico would violate Mexico's obligations under the NAALC. In accordance with its published Procedural Guidelines (71 FR 76694 (2006)), OTLA has 60 days, unless circumstances as determined by OTLA require an extension of time, to determine whether to accept a submission for review. OTLA has determined that circumstances require an extension of time to determine whether to accept the Submission. The U.S. Secretary of Labor and the Mexican Minister of Labor and Social Welfare are scheduled to meet this month. Part of the discussion will include issues germane to the subject of the Submission. In light of these forthcoming discussions, and because the subject of the Submission is proposed legislation that is being debated in the Mexican legislative session that concludes on April 30, 2018, OTLA has determined that it is prudent to extend the time period for determining whether to accept the Submission for review.",Notice,The Office of Trade and Labor Affairs (OTLA) in the Bureau of International Labor Affairs of the U.S. Department of Labor has determined that an extension of time is required for its decision on whether to accept Submission #2018-01 for review...,DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,labor-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/labor-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/21/2018-05866/bureau-of-international-labor-affairs-office-of-trade-and-labor-affairs-north-american-agreement-on,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-03-21/pdf/2018-05866.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-05866.pdf?1521549936,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/271.json,

If granted, the EFPs would authorize the applicants, with certain conditions, to set the season(s) for red snapper caught by the private angling component, the Federal charter vessel/headboat (for-hire) component, or both, as applicable, and landed in each respective state. The EFPs would do so by exempting persons from the annual closed Federal fishing seasons if they are landing red snapper in the participating states during the states' open seasons as set by those states, and described in more detail below. These annual closed Federal fishing seasons are the seasonal closure for red snapper which is January 1 through May 31 each year, and the closures that occur based on when NMFS projects that the red snapper annual catch targets will be reached. The private angling component includes state-permitted for-hire vessels and any red snapper landings by these for-hire vessels would be counted against the private angling component quota. However, these state-permitted for-hire vessels would not be able to fish in Federal waters. NMFS would set separate Federal seasons for Federally permitted for-hire vessels and private-anglers not covered by any EFP. Red snapper landings would be monitored by the respective states and the state seasons set under the EFPs would close when a state's assigned quota is reached, or projected to be reached. These studies, to be conducted in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), are intended to test the effectiveness of Gulf state management of recreationally caught red snapper.

The supplements are being added to implement Presidential Proclamations 9704 and 9705 of March 8, 2018 (``Proclamations''), adjusting imports of steel articles identified in Proclamation 9705 (``steel'') and aluminum articles identified in Proclamation 9704 (``aluminum'') through the imposition of duties so that imports of steel articles and aluminum articles will no longer threaten to impair the national security. As set forth in the Proclamations, the President concurred with the findings of the Secretary of Commerce (``Secretary'') in two reports to the President on the investigations under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, of the effect of imports of steel and aluminum, respectively, on the national security of the United States. The Proclamations authorize the Secretary to grant exclusions from the duties upon request of affected parties if the steel or aluminum articles are determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality or based upon specific national security considerations. The President directed the Secretary to promulgate regulations as may be necessary to set forth the procedures for an exclusion process.",Rule,This interim final rule amends the National Security Industrial Base Regulations to add two new supplements.

This system of records allows the Department to maintain records that document the health screening, examination, and treatment of aliens arrested by the Department and detained by ICE for civil immigration purposes in facilities where the ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) provides or oversees the provision of care. As a result of a review of this system, the Department is updating this system of records to include two new routine uses to describe how the Department may share information from this system. The purpose of this system is also being updated to include the new IHSC Patient Medical Record Portal (the ``Portal''), whereby individuals discharged from Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities (either released from custody or removed from the United States) can log in and get a copy of their electronic medical record. As a result, a new category of records is being maintained in this system of records to support login capability for the Patient Medical Record Portal.

2018-05345,2018-03-16,221,Health and Human Services Department,Food and Drug Administration,Tobacco Product Standard for Nicotine Level of Combusted Cigarettes,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to obtain information for consideration in developing a tobacco product standard to set the maximum nicotine level for cigarettes. Because tobacco-related harms ultimately result from addiction to the nicotine in such products, causing repeated use and exposure to toxicants, FDA is considering taking this action to reduce the level of nicotine in these products so they are minimally addictive or nonaddictive, using the best available science to determine a level that is appropriate for the protection of the public health. FDA is using the term ``nonaddictive'' in this document specifically in the context of a potentially nonaddictive cigarette. We acknowledge the highly addictive potential of nicotine itself depending upon the route of delivery. As discussed elsewhere in this document, questions remain with respect to the precise level of nicotine in cigarettes that might render them either minimally addictive or nonaddictive for specific members or segments of the population. We envision the potential circumstance where nicotine levels in cigarettes do not spur or sustain addiction for some portion of potential smokers.

The final CTG provided recommendations for reducing volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from existing oil and natural gas industry emission sources in ozone nonattainment (NA) areas classified as Moderate or higher and states in the Ozone Transport Region (OTR). The CTG relied upon underlying data and conclusions made in the final rule titled ``Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources,'' published in the Federal Register on June 3, 2016 (2016 New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)). On June 5, 2017, the EPA granted reconsideration in regard to additional provisions of the 2016 NSPS. Pursuant to those actions, the EPA is currently looking broadly at the 2016 NSPS. In light of the fact that the EPA is reconsidering the 2016 NSPS and because the recommendations made in the CTG are fundamentally linked to the conclusions in the 2016 NSPS, the EPA believes it is prudent to withdraw the CTG in its entirety. The EPA also believes that the withdrawal will be more efficient for states in revising their state implementation plans (SIPs).
