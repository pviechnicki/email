2018-02598,2018-02-09,221,Health and Human Services Department,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Announcement of Requirements and Registration for the 2018 Million HeartsÂ® Hypertension Control Challenge,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announces the launch of the 2018 Million Hearts[supreg] Hypertension Control Challenge. Million Hearts[supreg] is a national initiative to prevent one million heart attacks and strokes by 2022. In order to prevent one million events, we need to decrease smoking, sodium consumption and physical inactivity by 20%; improve performance on appropriate aspirin use, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation to 80%; and improve outcomes for priority populations. Over the last five years we have seen tremendous progress by provider and health care systems that focus on improving their performance in controlling blood pressure. Getting to 80% control would mean that 10 million more Americans would have their blood pressure under control, and be at substantially lower risk for strokes, heart attacks and other cardiovascular events. For more information about the initiative, visit https://millionhearts. hhs.gov/. The Million Hearts Hypertension Control challenge is an important way to call attention to the need for improved blood pressure control, provides a powerful motivation and target for clinicians, and will improve understanding of successful implementation strategies at the health system level. The Million Hearts Hypertension Control Challenge will identify clinicians, clinical practices, and health systems that have exceptional rates of hypertension control and recognize them as 2018 Million Hearts[supreg] Hypertension Control Champions. To support improved quality of care delivered to patients with hypertension, Million Hearts[supreg] will document and further disseminate the systems, strategies, processes, and staffing that contribute to the exceptional blood pressure control rates achieved by Champions.",Notice,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announces the launch of the 2018 Million Hearts[supreg] Hypertension Control Challenge.

This submission addresses the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) requirements applicable to Alabama state boards or agency personnel with respect to the approval of permits or enforcement orders. The submission also specifically addresses requirements for implementation of the following national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS): 1997, 2006, and 2012 Fine Particulate Matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>), 2008 8-hour Ozone, 2008 Lead, 2010 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>), and 2010 Sulfur Dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>). The CAA requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance and enforcement of each NAAQS promulgated by EPA. Whenever EPA promulgates a new or revised NAAQS, the CAA requires the state to make a new SIP submission establishing that the existing SIP meets the various applicable requirements, or revising the SIP to meet those requirements. This type of SIP submission is commonly referred to as an ``infrastructure'' SIP. In this proposed action, EPA is proposing to approve the October 24, 2017, submission with respect to: (1) The requirements applicable to state boards of the CAA; and (2) the related state board infrastructure SIP requirements for the 1997, 2006, and 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF>, 2008 8-hour Ozone, 2008 Lead, 2010 NO<INF>2</INF>, and 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS.

This action would amend the SNUR to allow certain new uses reported in the SNUN without requiring additional SNUNs and make the lack of certain worker protections a new use. EPA is proposing this amendment based on review of new and existing data as described for the chemical substance. A SNUR requires persons who intend to manufacture (including import) or process this chemical substance for an activity that is designated as a significant new use by this proposed rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity.

2018-02204,2018-02-06,277,Library of Congress,"Copyright Office, Library of Congress",Streamlining the Single Application and Clarifying Eligibility Requirements,"On December 16, 2017, the U.S. Copyright Office released a new version of the Single Application, an online registration option that allows a single author to register a claim in one work that is solely owned by the same author and is not a work made for hire. The new Single Application includes enhanced features that should improve the user experience, increase the efficiency of the examination, and reduce the correspondence rate for these types of claims. To coincide with these technical upgrades, the Office is now proposing to amend its regulations to clarify the eligibility requirements for the Single Application, and codify certain practices set forth in the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, Third Edition. In addition, the proposed rule confirms that the Single Application may be used to register one sound recording and one musical work, literary work, or dramatic work--notwithstanding the fact that a sound recording and the work embodied in that recording are separate works. The proposed rule will also clarify the eligibility requirements for the Office's Standard Application, which is used to register certain works that are ineligible for the Single Application, such as works with more than one owner. In addition, the proposed rule will eliminate the ``short form'' version of the Office's paper applications, and make technical amendments to the regulations governing preregistration, architectural works, mask works, vessel designs, the unit of publication registration option, and the group registration option for database updates. The proposed rule will also allow for paper applications to be certified with a typed or printed signature by removing the requirement that the certification must include a ``handwritten'' signature of the certifying party.",Proposed Rule,"On December 16, 2017, the U.S. Copyright Office released a new version of the Single Application, an online registration option that allows a single author to register a claim in one work that is solely owned by the same author and is not a work made...",LIBRARY OF CONGRESS,library-of-congress,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/library-of-congress,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/06/2018-02204/streamlining-the-single-application-and-clarifying-eligibility-requirements,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-02-06/pdf/2018-02204.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-02204.pdf?1517838325,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/277.json,

2018-01879,2018-01-31,335,National Credit Union Administration,,Modernizing Data Collection for Supervision of Credit Unions,"At the May 19, 2016, meeting of the NCUA Board, the agency discussed plans for modernizing NCUA's collection of data from federally insured credit unions. Key goals of the modernization effort include reducing the reporting burden on credit unions, improving offsite supervision capability, and updating the organization of the forms and related instructions. In June 2016, the NCUA issued a Request for Information in the Federal Register seeking public input on the regulatory data collected through the Call Report and Profile, resulting in 684 individual comments. In September 2016, the Call Report Modernization Working Group solicited feedback from agency staff and state supervisory authorities, resulting in 492 comments. The working group also hosted phone calls with state supervisory authorities and credit unions representing each of the five asset peer groups during October 2016. These calls gave stakeholders an additional opportunity to have a dialogue on recommendations for the Call Report and Profile. The working group reviewed all stakeholder comments and posted summaries of the comments on the NCUA's Call Report Modernization web page. The working group also conducted additional technical research, such as on generally accepted accounting principles relevant to the Call Report. The working group's comprehensive analysis resulted in this proposal to reorganize the schedules in the Call Report and Profile, retire obsolete account codes, and relocate some account codes to other collections. The proposed streamlining for the Call Report results in a net reduction of roughly 40 percent of account codes. The proposed changes to the Profile result in approximately a 20 percent net reduction. The proposed updates to the 5300 Call Report and 4501A Profile forms, instructions, and related background material are available for review and comment, online at https://www.ncua.gov/About/Pages/open- government/call-report-modernization.aspx.

The final rule will also require applicants to file an online application rather than a paper application, and upload a complete digital copy of each issue through the Office's electronic registration system instead of submitting them in physical form.

The final amendments address continuous monitoring on pressure relief devices (PRDs) on containers. This issue was raised in a petition for reconsideration of the 2015 amendments to the OSWRO NESHAP, which were based on the residual risk and technology review (RTR). Among other things, the 2015 amendments established additional monitoring requirements for all PRDs, including PRDs on containers. For PRDs on containers, these monitoring requirements were in addition to the inspection and monitoring requirements for containers and their closure devices already required by the OSWRO NESHAP. This final action removes the additional monitoring requirements for PRDs on containers that resulted from the 2015 amendments because we have determined that they are not necessary. This action does not substantially change the level of environmental protection provided under the OSWRO NESHAP, but reduces burden to this industry compared to the current rule by $28 million in capital costs related to compliance, and $4.2 million per year in total annualized costs under a 7 percent interest rate.

Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the RRB's estimate of the burden of the collection of the information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden related to the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 1. Title and purpose of information collection: Railroad Service and Compensation Reports/System Access Application; OMB 3220-0008. Under Section 9 of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and Section 6 of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA), the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) maintains for each railroad employee, a record of compensation paid to that employee by all railroad employers for whom the employee worked after 1936. This record, which is used by the RRB to determine eligibility for, and amount of, benefits due under the laws it administers, is conclusive as to the amount of compensation paid to an employee during such period(s) covered by the report(s) of the compensation by the employee's railroad employer(s), except in cases when an employee files a protest pertaining to his or her reported compensation within the statute of limitations cited in Section 9 of the RRA and Section 6 of the RUIA. To enable the RRB to establish and maintain the record of compensation, employers are required to file with the RRB, reports of their employees' compensation, in such manner and form and at such times as the RRB prescribes. Railroad employers' reports and responsibilities are prescribed in 20 CFR 209. The RRB currently utilizes Form BA-3, Annual Report of Creditable Compensation, and Form BA-4, Report of Creditable Compensation Adjustments, to secure the required information from railroad employers. Form BA-3 provides the RRB with information regarding annual creditable service and compensation for each individual who worked for a railroad employer covered by the RRA and RUIA in a given year. Form BA-4 provides for the adjustment of any previously submitted reports and also the opportunity to provide any service and compensation that had been previously omitted. Requirements specific to Forms BA-3 and BA-4 are prescribed in 20 CFR 209.8 and 209.9. Employers currently have the option of submitting BA-3 and BA-4 reports electronically by CD-ROM, secure Email, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or online via the RRB's Employer Reporting System (ERS). The information collection also includes RRB Form BA-12, Application for Employer Reporting internet Access, and Form G-440, Report Specifications Sheet. Form BA-12 is completed by railroad employers to obtain system access to ERS. Once access is obtained, authorized employees may submit reporting forms online to the RRB. The form determines what degree of access (view/only, data entry/ modification or approval/submission) is appropriate for that employee. It is also used to terminate an employee's access to ERS. Form G-440, Report Specifications Sheet, serves as a certification document for Forms BA-3 and BA-4 as well as other RRB employer reporting forms (Form BA-6a, BA-6 Address Report (OMB 3220-0005), Form BA-9, Report of Separation Allowance or Severance Pay (OMB 3220-0173) and Form BA-11, Report of Gross Earnings (OMB 3220-0132)). It records the type of medium the report was submitted on, and serves as a summary recapitulation sheet for reports filed on paper. The RRB proposes minor non-burden impacting changes to Form BA-12 and G-440.",Notice,"In accordance with the requirement of Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 which provides opportunity for public comment on new or revised data collections, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) will publish periodic summaries of...",RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD,railroad-retirement-board,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/railroad-retirement-board,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/01/26/2018-01347/proposed-collection-comment-request,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-01-26/pdf/2018-01347.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-01347.pdf?1516887937,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/444.json,

The RRB invites comments on the proposed collection of information to determine (1) the practical utility of the collection; (2) the accuracy of the estimated burden of the collection; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information that is the subject of collection; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of collections on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Comments to the RRB or OIRA must contain the OMB control number of the ICR. For proper consideration of your comments, it is best if the RRB and OIRA receive them within 30 days of the publication date. Title and purpose of information collection: Student Beneficiary Monitoring; OMB 3220-0123. Under provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA), there are two types of benefit payments that are based on the status of a child being in full-time elementary or secondary school attendance at age 18-19: (1) A survivor child's annuity benefit under Section 2(d)(1)(iii) and (2) an increase in the employee retirement annuity under the Special Guaranty computation as prescribed in section 3(f)(2) and 20 CFR 229. The survivor student annuity is usually paid by direct deposit to a financial institution either into the student's checking or savings account or into a joint bank account with a parent. The requirements for eligibility as a student are prescribed in 20 CFR 216.74, and include students in independent study and home schooling. To help determine if a child is entitled to student benefits, the RRB requires evidence of full-time school attendance. This evidence is acquired through the RRB's student monitoring program, which utilizes the following forms. Form G-315, Student Questionnaire, obtains certification of a student's full-time school attendance as well as information on the student's marital status, social security benefits, and employment, which are needed to determine entitlement or continued entitlement to benefits under the RRA. Form G-315A, Statement of School Official, is used to obtain, from a school, verification of a student's full-time attendance when the student fails to return a monitoring Form G-315. Form G-315A.1, School Official's Notice of Cessation of Full- Time School Attendance, is used by a school to notify the RRB that a student has ceased full-time school attendance. Previous Requests for Comments: The RRB has already published the initial 60-day notice (82 FR 55426 on November 21, 2017) required by 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2). That request elicited no comments.",Notice,"In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C.

The purpose of Section 6(o) of the Food and Nutrition Act is to establish a time limit of the receipt of benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for certain able-bodied adults who are not working. The provision authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, upon a State agency's request, to waive the provision for any group of individuals if the Secretary determines ``that the area in which the individuals reside has an unemployment rate of over 10 percent, or does not have a sufficient number of jobs to provide employment for the individuals.'' As required by the statute, in order to receive a waiver the State agency must submit sufficient supporting information so that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) can make the required determination as to the area's unemployment rate or insufficiency of available jobs.

2018-00826,2018-01-19,492,Transportation Department,Federal Aviation Administration,Agency Information Collection Activities: Requests for Comments; Clearance of a Renewed Approval of Information Collection: Helicopter Air Ambulance Operator Reports,"In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on November 3, 2017 (82 FR 51331). The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 mandates that all helicopter air ambulance operators must begin reporting the number of flights and hours flown, along with other specified information, during which helicopters operated by the certificate holder are providing helicopter air ambulance services. The helicopter air ambulance operational data provided to the FAA is used by the agency as background information useful in the development of risk mitigation strategies to reduce the helicopter air ambulance accident rate, and to meet the mandates set by Congress. In response to the November 3, 2017 notice and request for comments, the FAA received two comments. One comment from an individual and one comment from the Air Medical Operators Association (AMOA). The individual commented that the hourly burden per average response estimate has increased since the last notice was published on July 29, 2014 (79 FR 44083) and asked for the reason for the change in estimated burden. In response, the FAA clarifies that none of the requirements have changed, but operator data have changed. The overall number of operators has decreased. Additionally, the number of large operators (to which we attribute a higher hourly burden) has increased and the number of small operators (to which we attribute a lower hourly burden) has decreased. Therefore, in the aggregate, the average hourly burden increased from six (6) hours to eleven (11) hours per operator. The AMOA commented that they strongly supported the intent of the data collection requirement, but also noted that the original collection requirement should have been the subject of notice and comment rulemaking. The FAA notes, as indicated in the August 12, 2013 Requests for Comments; Clearance of a New Approval of Information Collection: Helicopter Air Ambulance Operator Reports (78 FR 48925), that prior to issuance of the first information collection notice, representatives from the Flight Standards Service, Office of Accident Investigation and Prevention, and the Office of the Chief Counsel met with representatives from AMOA to discuss the FAA's approach to this data collection. Meetings were held on October 15, 2012 and May 17, 2013. On June 28, 2013 AMOA submitted a response to the FAA discussing its view of the method to collect the data being pursued by the FAA. A copy of that letter was placed in the docket (FAA-2013-0684) and was considered by the agency. AMOA also commented that the FAA has underestimated the hourly burden for both large and small operators. Although AMOA did not provide any specific data to support its comment, in response the FAA has increased the estimates of hourly burden for both large and small operators in this notice and request for comments. AMOA also requested information from the FAA's Office of Accident Investigation and Prevention and commented on the FAA's implementation of certain provisions of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which are both beyond the scope of this clearance of a renewed approval of information collection.",Notice,"In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection.

2018-00671,2018-01-18,492,Transportation Department,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,Removing Regulatory Barriers for Vehicles With Automated Driving Systems,"NHTSA seeks public comments to identify any regulatory barriers in the existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) to the testing, compliance certification and compliance verification of motor vehicles with Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) and certain unconventional interior designs. NHTSA is focusing primarily, but not exclusively, on vehicles with ADSs that lack controls for a human driver; e.g., steering wheel, brake pedal or accelerator pedal. The absence of manual driving controls, and thus of a human driver, poses potential barriers to testing, compliance certification and compliance verification. For example, many of the FMVSS refer to the ``driver'' or ``driver's seating position'' in specifying where various vehicle features and systems need to be located so that they can be seen and/or used by a person sitting in that position. Further, the compliance test procedures of some FMVSS depend on the presence of such things as a human test driver who can follow instructions on test driving maneuvers or a steering wheel that can be used by an automated steering machine. NHTSA also seeks comments on the research that would be needed to determine how to amend the FMVSS in order to remove such barriers, while retaining those existing safety requirements that will be needed and appropriate for those vehicles. In all cases, the Agency's goal would be to ensure the maintenance of currently required levels of safety performance. These comments will aid the Agency in setting research priorities as well as inform its subsequent actions to lay a path for innovative vehicle designs and technologies that feature ADSs.",Proposed Rule,"NHTSA seeks public comments to identify any regulatory barriers in the existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) to the testing, compliance certification and compliance verification of motor vehicles with Automated Driving Systems (ADSs)...",DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION,transportation-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/transportation-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/01/18/2018-00671/removing-regulatory-barriers-for-vehicles-with-automated-driving-systems,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-01-18/pdf/2018-00671.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-00671.pdf?1516196726,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/492.json,

The proposed amendments also include limited mooring standards, limitations on expansions of floating cabins, and requirements for owners to register their floating cabins. Additional health, safety, and environmental standards for floating cabins will be addressed in a later rulemaking once TVA has had the opportunity to discuss such standards with various stakeholders.

When we listed the orangutan in 1970, the listed entity included all orangutans in the genus Pongo. At that time, the scientific community recognized one species (Pongo pygmaeus) in the genus Pongo, which consisted of two subspecies (P. pygmaeus pygmaeus and P. p. abelii). However, the orangutan has recently been reclassified as belonging to two distinct species: P. pygmaeus and P. abelii. Therefore, we are revising the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife to reflect the current scientifically accepted taxonomy and nomenclature of the orangutan. Because all orangutans in the genus Pongo are already included under the original listing of Pongo pygmaeus as endangered under the Act, the newly recognized taxonomic species is considered part of the original listed entity, and this technical correction does not alter the regulatory protections afforded to the orangutan. For the same reason, if other Pongo species emerge due to future taxonomic revisions to further subdivide the genus Pongo, they would be encompassed by the original listing and this technical correction.",Rule,"We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the revised taxonomy of the orangutan under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act).

(Jiangsu Senmao) and Jilin Forest Industry Jinqiao Flooring Group Co., Ltd. (Jinqiao Flooring). We preliminarily determine that sales of subject merchandise by Jiangsu Senmao have not been made at prices below normal value (NV) and that Jinqiao Flooring is not eligible for a separate rate and, therefore, remains part of the China-wide entity. In addition, we are preliminarily granting separate rates to 70 producers/exporters, including Jiangsu Senmao, and determine that 16 producer/exporters made no shipments of subject merchandise during the POR.
