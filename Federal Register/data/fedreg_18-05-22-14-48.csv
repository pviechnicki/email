First, to address the hiring challenge faced by small LEAs, those with 2,499 or fewer students, this rule would require relevant food service experience rather than school nutrition program experience for new directors. Second, it would provide State agencies with discretion to consider volunteer or unpaid work as relevant food service experience for new school nutrition program directors in small LEAs. Third, to further assist LEAs with less than 500 students, this proposed rule would expand the existing regulatory flexibility which gives State agencies discretion to accept less than the required years of food service experience when an applicant for a new director position has the minimum required education. Fourth, this rule would also add flexibility to the hiring standards for State directors of school nutrition programs by considering applicants with either a bachelor's or a master's degree in specific, relevant fields.

Based on that assessment, NMFS determined that North Atlantic shortfin mako sharks were overfished and experiencing overfishing in December 2017. Management alternatives considered would be to meet NMFS's obligations related to ending overfishing and establishing a foundation for rebuilding the shortfin mako shark stock consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA).

The island's shoreline has been managed in some capacity for over 35 years by Federal projects administered through the COE Civil Works program and by non-federal projects implemented by the County, and/or local municipalities through the COE Regulatory permit program. Since 1978, roughly 11 million cubic yards of sand have been placed upon the beaches of Bogue Banks at a total cost of approximately $95 million. Past management efforts have largely consisted of stand-alone projects that were undertaken to address site- specific erosional problems. This stand-alone approach has limited the efficiency and effectiveness of past and current efforts by the County and island municipalities to implement shore protection projects and to maintain the beaches. In order to address ongoing shoreline erosion in a more effective manner, the County and island municipalities (Towns of Atlantic Beach, Pine Knoll Shores, Indian Beach, and Emerald Isle) are proposing to combine their shore protection efforts under a more efficient comprehensive 50-year beach and inlet management plan known as the Bogue Banks Master Beach Nourishment Plan (BBMBNP).",Notice,"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), Wilmington District, Wilmington Regulatory Field Office has received a request for Department of the Army authorization, pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors...",DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,defense-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/defense-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/05/2018-04408/the-release-of-the-final-environmental-impact-statement-feis-for-the-bogue-banks-master-beach,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-03-05/pdf/2018-04408.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-04408.pdf?1519998376,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/103.json,

On August 8-10, 2017, the Agency conducted a baseline inspection of the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP)'s transuranic (TRU) waste characterization program at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), in accordance with the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Compliance Criteria and Condition 3 of the EPA's initial May 13, 1998 WIPP certification, as amended. The inspection evaluated the technical adequacy of this program's characterization of contact- handled TRU debris and solid waste. The EPA is proposing to approve a new AMWTP baseline that includes the significant changes that have been implemented at INL since mid-2016. The TRU waste characterization program changes, particularly to the Acceptable Knowledge process, referred to as ``enhanced AK'', address deficiencies identified by the Department of Energy (DOE) as among the root causes of the February 2014 radiation release at the WIPP. The EPA's draft baseline inspection report is available for review in the public dockets listed in the ADDRESSES section of this document. Until the EPA finalizes its baseline approval decision, the DOE Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO) may not recertify the AMWTP's TRU waste characterization program and the AMWTP may not ship any TRU waste unless it meets the requirements of the June 2017 revisions to the DOE's WIPP Waste Acceptance Criteria to the WIPP for disposal.",Notice,"The Environmental Protection Agency ((EPA) or the Agency) is announcing the availability of, and soliciting public comment on, this proposed action.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) does not tolerate sexual harassment, or any kind of harassment, within the agency, at awardee organizations, field sites, or anywhere NSF-funded science and education are conducted. The 2,000 U.S. institutions of higher education and other organizations that receive NSF funds are responsible for fully investigating complaints and for complying with federal non-discrimination law. NSF has taken steps to help ensure research environments are free from sexual harassment. Additionally, NSF is bolstering our policies, guidelines and communications so that organizations funded by NSF clearly understand expectations and requirements. NSF is working to make certain that recipients of grants and cooperative agreements respond promptly and appropriately to instances of sexual harassment, other forms of harassment, or sexual assault. A community effort is essential to eliminate sexual and other forms of harassment in science and to build scientific workspaces where people can learn, grow and thrive.",Notice,"The National Science Foundation (NSF) is soliciting public comment on the agency's proposed implementation of the new reporting requirements specified in NSF Important Notice No. 144, dated February 8, 2018.

This notice announces a public process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues relating to the management of Atlantic HMS, with a focus on area-based management measures and weak hook management measures that were implemented to reduce dead discards of bluefin tuna in the pelagic longline fishery. NMFS would use the scoping process and the draft environmental impact analysis to develop a regulatory action applicable to the pelagic longline fishery. The scoping process and draft environmental impact analysis are intended to determine if existing area-based and weak hook management measures are the best means of achieving the current management objectives and providing flexibility to adapt to fishing variability in the future, consistent with the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA), and other relevant Federal laws. NMFS is also announcing the availability of a scoping document describing potential measures for inclusion in a future regulatory action. NMFS will hold scoping meetings to gather public comment on potential management options for area based and weak hook requirements. The time and location details of the scoping meetings are available in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this notice. NMFS is requesting comments on the NOI to develop environmental impact assessments.

The Application requests blanket authorization to export domestically produced and previously imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) in an amount up to the equivalent of 255 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas on a cumulative basis over a two-year period, commencing on the date of the initial short-term export. The LNG would be exported from the Elba Liquefaction Project (Liquefaction Project), which is currently under construction at the Elba Island Terminal on Elba Island, Chatham County, Georgia.

2018-03985,2018-02-27,145,Environmental Protection Agency,,Inquiry To Learn Whether Businesses Assert Business Confidentiality Claims Regarding Waste Import and Export,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) occasionally receives Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for documentation received or issued by EPA or data contained in EPA database systems pertaining to the export and import of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste from/to the United States, the export of cathode ray tubes (CRTs), the export and import of spent lead acid batteries (SLABs) from the United States, and the export and import of RCRA universal waste from/to the United States. The purpose of this notice is to inform ``affected businesses'' about the documents or data sought by these types of FOIA requests in order to provide the businesses with the opportunity to assert claims that any of the information sought that pertains to them is entitled to treatment as confidential business information (CBI), and to send comments to EPA supporting their claims for such treatment. ``Affected businesses'' are businesses identified or referenced in the documents that were submitted to EPA by the submitting business which may have a right to assert a CBI claim concerning information that pertains to them and may do so in response to this notice. Certain businesses, however, do not meet the definition of ``affected business,'' and are not covered by today's notice. They consist of any business that actually submitted to EPA any document at issue pursuant to applicable RCRA regulatory requirements and did not assert a CBI claim as to information that pertains to that business in connection with the document at the time of its submission; they have waived their right to do so at a later time. This notice also serves to inform the public that based on the Confidentiality Determinations for Hazardous Waste Export and Import Documents, EPA-HQ-OLEM-2016-0492, published on December 26, 2017 (Confidentiality Rule), this is the last time EPA will be publishing the Federal Register Notice ``Inquiry to Learn Whether Businesses Assert Business Confidentiality Claims.'' Effective June 26, 2018, the Confidentiality Rule applies a confidentiality determination such that no person can assert confidential business information (CBI) claims for documents related to the export, import, and transit of hazardous waste, including those hazardous waste managed under the alternate standards, and excluded cathode ray tubes (CRTs). Therefore, publication of this Federal Register notice will no longer be needed since ``affected businesses'' will no longer be able to claim CBI on any documents on which they are listed.",Notice,The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) occasionally receives Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for documentation received or issued by EPA or data contained in EPA database systems pertaining to the export and import of Resource...,ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY,environmental-protection-agency,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-03985/inquiry-to-learn-whether-businesses-assert-business-confidentiality-claims-regarding-waste-import,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-02-27/pdf/2018-03985.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-03985.pdf?1519652801,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145.json,

EPA's light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas program acknowledges these benefits by giving automobile manufacturers several options for generating ``off-cycle'' carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) credits. Under the regulations, a manufacturer may apply for CO<INF>2</INF> credits for off-cycle technologies that result in off-cycle benefits. In these cases, a manufacturer must provide EPA with a proposed methodology for determining the real-world off-cycle benefit. These two manufacturers have submitted applications that describe methodologies for determining off-cycle credits. The off-cycle technologies vary by manufacturer and include thermal control technologies such as high efficiency alternators, an efficient air conditioning compressor, and active climate control seats. Pursuant to applicable regulations, EPA is making descriptions of each manufacturer's off-cycle credit calculation methodologies available for public comment.",Notice,"EPA is requesting comment on applications General Motors (GM), and Toyota Motor North America (Toyota) for off-cycle carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) credits under EPA's light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards. ``Off-cycle'' emission...",ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY,environmental-protection-agency,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/26/2018-03846/alternative-method-for-calculating-off-cycle-credits-under-the-light-duty-vehicle-greenhouse-gas,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-02-26/pdf/2018-03846.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-03846.pdf?1519393574,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145.json,

2018-03736,2018-02-23,497,Treasury Department,Comptroller of the Currency,Agency Information Collection Activities: Submission for OMB Review; Joint Comment Request,"In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. On October 6, 2017, the agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), requested public comment for 60 days on the implementation of the proposed Annual Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Test Report for Depository Institutions and Holding Companies with $10-$50 Billion in Total Consolidated Assets (FFIEC 016). The comment period for the proposal expired on December 5, 2017, and the agencies did not receive any comments. The agencies are now submitting the FFIEC 016, as originally proposed, to OMB for review. Subject to OMB approval, the proposed FFIEC 016 would take effect for the stress test report due July 31, 2018. The proposed FFIEC 016 would combine the agencies' three separate, yet identical, stress test report forms (as described in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION), which are currently approved collections of information, into a single new FFIEC report. The respondents for the proposed FFIEC 016 are depository institutions and holding companies with average total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, but less than $50 billion. As part of their proposed adoption of the new FFIEC 016 report, the agencies also are proposing to implement a limited number of revisions that would align the report with recent changes to the FFIEC 031 and FFIEC 041 Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income and the Board's FR Y-9C Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies. In addition, the agencies are proposing to have institutions provide their Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) on the report form, if they already have one. The proposed FFIEC 016 reporting requirements reflect the company-run stress testing requirements promulgated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (as reflected in the agencies' current information collections). The Board, in connection with this proposal, has approved the transition of the FR Y-16 (Annual Company-Run Stress Test Report For State Member Banks, Bank Holding Companies, and Savings and Loan Holding Companies with Total Consolidated Assets Greater Than $10 Billion and Less Than $50 Billion), which it currently uses to collect the annual company-run stress test results, to the FFIEC 016, conditioned on the approval of the FFIEC 016 by the OMB. Also in connection with the final adoption of the FFIEC 016, the OCC and the FDIC are proposing to replace the OCC's DFAST 10-50B (Annual Company- Run Stress Test Reporting Template and Documentation for Covered Institutions with Total Consolidated Assets of $10 Billion to $50 Billion under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), and the FDIC's DFAST 10-50 (Company-Run Annual Stress Test Reporting Template and Documentation for Covered Institutions with Total Consolidated Assets of $10 Billion to $50 Billion under the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), respectively, with the FFIEC 016.",Notice,"In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays...",DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,treasury-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/treasury-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/23/2018-03736/agency-information-collection-activities-submission-for-omb-review-joint-comment-request,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-02-23/pdf/2018-03736.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-03736.pdf?1519307166,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/497.json,

2018-02560,2018-02-21,497,Treasury Department,Comptroller of the Currency,Margin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities; Proposed Rule,"The Board, OCC, FDIC, FCA, and FHFA (each an Agency and, collectively, the Agencies) are seeking comment on proposed amendments to the minimum margin requirements for registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security- based swap participants for which one of the Agencies is the prudential regulator (Swap Margin Rule). The Agencies are proposing these amendments in light of the rules recently adopted by the Board, the OCC, and the FDIC that impose restrictions on certain non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps and other financial contracts (Covered QFCs) (the QFC Rules). The QFC Rules amend the definition of ``Qualifying Master Netting Agreement'' in the Federal banking agencies' regulatory capital and liquidity rules to ensure that a Covered QFC is not prevented from being part of a Qualifying Master Netting Agreement solely because the Covered QFC conforms to the new requirements in the QFC Rules. The FCA also plans to propose amendments to its capital rules, including potential revisions to its regulatory definition of ``Qualifying Master Netter Agreement,'' which is expected to be identical to the definition used in the Federal banking agencies' regulatory capital and liquidity rules. The Agencies are proposing to amend the definition of ``Eligible Master Netting Agreement'' in the Swap Margin Rule so that it remains harmonized with the amended definition of ``Qualifying Master Netting Agreement'' in the Federal banking agencies' regulatory capital and liquidity rules, and amendments to the capital rules that the FCA separately plans to propose. This proposed rule would also ensure that netting agreements of firms subject to the Swap Margin Rule are not excluded from the definition of ``Eligible Master Netting Agreement'' based solely on their compliance with the QFC Rules. The Agencies are also proposing that any legacy non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap (i.e., a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security- based swap entered into before the applicable compliance date) that is not subject to the margin requirements of the Swap Margin Rule would not become subject to the provisions of the Swap Margin Rule if the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap is amended solely to comply with the requirements of the QFC Rules.",Proposed Rule,"The Board, OCC, FDIC, FCA, and FHFA (each an Agency and, collectively, the Agencies) are seeking comment on proposed amendments to the minimum margin requirements for registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and...",DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,treasury-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/treasury-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/21/2018-02560/margin-and-capital-requirements-for-covered-swap-entities-proposed-rule,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-02-21/pdf/2018-02560.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-02560.pdf?1519134327,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/497.json,

Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the RRB's estimate of the burden of the collection of the information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden related to the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 1. Title and purpose of information collection: Appeal Under the Railroad Retirement and Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act; OMB 3220- 0007. Under Section 7(b)(3) of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA), and Section 5(c) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) any person aggrieved by a decision made by an office of the RRB on his or her application for an annuity or benefit under those Acts has the right to appeal to the RRB. This right is prescribed in 20 CFR 260 and 20 CFR 320. The notification letter, which is provided at the time of filing the original application, informs the applicant of such right. When an applicant protests a decision, the concerned RRB office reviews the entire file and any additional evidence submitted and sends the applicant a letter explaining the basis of the determination. The applicant is then notified that to protest further, they can appeal to the RRB's Bureau of Hearings and Appeals. The appeal process is prescribed in 20 CFR 260.5 and 260.9 and 20 CFR 320.12 and 320.38. To file a request for an appeal the applicant must complete Form HA-1, Appeal Under the Railroad Retirement Act or Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.

It is FNS' responsibility to establish and support the meal patterns and nutrition standards (collectively referred to as meal patterns) in the Child Nutrition Programs that advance the goals of providing nutritious and satisfying meals to a broad population of children. At the same time, FNS works to simplify the menu planning process for Program operators to promote the efficient use of Program funds and provide a wide variety of food choices to menu planners and children. In order to claim Federal reimbursement, Child Nutrition Program operators must serve meals and snacks that meet the minimum meal pattern requirements of the respective Program. Crediting is the process designed by FNS to specify how individual food items contribute to the Child Nutrition Programs' meal patterns. Several factors impact how food products can credit toward reimbursable meals, such as volume, weight, and overall nutrient profile. The purpose of this Request for Information is to help FNS gather feedback from a wide variety of stakeholders on how FNS' crediting system can best address today's evolving food and nutrition environment, as well as to offer first-rate customer service to those operating and benefitting from the Child Nutrition Programs. FNS welcomes comments from all interested stakeholders. While FNS is interested in your general comments about the crediting process, FNS also invites comments on the crediting of several specific food products. FNS is especially interested in understanding both the possible benefits and any negative impacts associated with potential changes to how certain foods may or may not credit.

2018-03219,2018-02-16,253,Interior Department,,Draft List of Critical Minerals,"The United States is heavily reliant on imports of certain mineral commodities that are vital to the Nation's security and economic prosperity. This dependency of the United States on foreign sources creates a strategic vulnerability for both its economy and military to adverse foreign government action, natural disaster, and other events that can disrupt supply of these key minerals. Pursuant to Executive Order 13817 issued on December 20, 2017, ``A Federal Strategy To Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals,'' the Secretary of the Interior presents a draft list of 35 mineral commodities deemed critical under the definition provided in the Executive Order. Specifically, an analysis using multiple criteria identified 35 minerals or mineral material groups that are currently considered critical. These include: Aluminum (bauxite), antimony, arsenic, barite, beryllium, bismuth, cesium, chromium, cobalt, fluorspar, gallium, germanium, graphite (natural), hafnium, helium, indium, lithium, magnesium, manganese, niobium, platinum group metals, potash, rare earth elements group, rhenium, rubidium, scandium, strontium, tantalum, tellurium, tin, titanium, tungsten, uranium, vanadium, and zirconium. These commodities merit consideration in furthering the policy of the Federal Government to reduce the Nation's vulnerability for the security and prosperity of the United States. A summary report describing the methodologies and data sources used to develop the draft critical minerals list may be accessed at https:// doi.org/10.3133/ofr20181021.

This rule will allow for very small amounts of directed, non-live bait fishing (referred to as ``minor directed fishing'') on CPS finfish to occur when a fishery is otherwise closed to directed fishing. Currently, when directed fishing is closed, a small sector of the CPS fishery that is not part of the primary commercial directed fishery has been precluded from landing even minor amounts because this activity does not fall under the existing exemptions for incidental harvest or for harvesting CPS to be sold as live bait. This rule allows this sector to continue directed fishing after other directed fisheries are closed, unless otherwise specified in a closure notice published by NMFS or if an applicable annual catch limit (ACL) is anticipated to be exceeded. To prevent exploitation of this rule to make large aggregate harvests, ``minor directed fishing'' would not be allowed to exceed landings of 1 metric ton (mt) per day per vessel or person or one fishing trip per day by any vessel. The purpose of this rule is to provide greater flexibility to small fishing operations, while continuing to conserve the target CPS fish stocks.",Rule,"NMFS is publishing this final rule to implement Amendment 16 of the Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP).

TVA will use the EIS process to elicit and prioritize the values and concerns of stakeholders; identify issues, trends, events, and tradeoffs affecting TVA's policies; formulate, evaluate and compare alternative portfolios of energy resource options; provide opportunities for public review and comment; and ensure that TVA's evaluation of alternative energy resource strategies reflects a full range of stakeholder input.

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) require rear identification lamps and rear clearance lamps to be located ``as close as practicable to the top of the vehicle.'' While the TrailerTail[supreg] aerodynamic device is currently mounted slightly below the roof of the vehicle, STEMCO states that this offset prevents the device from delivering the maximum available fuel economy benefit as opposed to mounting it flush with the top of the vehicle which may block the visibility of the rear identification lamps and rear clearance lamps.
