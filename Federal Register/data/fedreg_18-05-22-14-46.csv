Department of Homeland Security/ALL-041 External Biometric Records (EBR) System of Records (SOR) is one of two replacement system of records notices (SORN) for DHS/US-VISIT-001 DHS Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT). This SORN applies to records provided to DHS by non-DHS entities that do not fall under existing Component/DHS SORNs. The other replacement for the IDENT SORN will be a forthcoming technical SORN focused on the technical aspects of the IDENT system. After the technical SORN is published, DHS will rescind the IDENT SORN by publishing a notice of rescindment in the Federal Register. Components are responsible for maintaining SORN coverage for biometric and associated biographic information collected by that Component. Additionally, DHS is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act, elsewhere in the Federal Register. This newly established system will be included in the Department of Homeland Security's inventory of record systems.",Notice,"In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to establish a new DHS system of records titled, ``Department of Homeland Security/ALL-041 External Biometric Records (EBR) System of Records.''

The FMCSA requests approval to revise and extend the ``Annual Report of Class I and Class II Motor Carriers of Property'' ICR, OMB Control No. 2126-0032.

2018-08231,2018-04-20,227,Homeland Security Department,Agriculture Department,Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects: Proposed Six Month Delay of the General Compliance Date While Allowing the Use of Three Burden-Reducing Provisions During the Delay Period,"In a final rule published on January 19, 2017, federal departments and agencies made revisions to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (hereafter the ``2018 Requirements''). The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) adopted the same regulatory changes in a separate final rule published on September 18, 2017. The 2018 Requirements were scheduled to become effective on January 19, 2018, with a general compliance date of January 19, 2018 (with the exception of the revisions to the cooperative research provision). The departments and agencies listed in this document have also published an interim final rule delaying the effective date and general compliance date for the 2018 Requirements for six months, to cover the time period of January 19, 2018 until July 19, 2018. As per the interim final rule, the effective date of the 2018 Requirements is now July 19, 2018. The departments and agencies listed in this document propose delaying the general compliance date for the 2018 Requirements for an additional six months, for the time period of July 19, 2018 until January 21, 2019. This proposed rule is intended to provide additional time to regulated entities for the preparations necessary to implement the 2018 Requirements. This proposed rule, if finalized, would require regulated entities to continue to comply with the requirements of the current Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (hereafter the ``pre-2018 Requirements'') until January 21, 2019. This proposal also takes comment on whether to permit institutions to implement, for certain research studies, the following provisions in the 2018 Requirements during the period from July 19, 2018, until January 21, 2019, that the general compliance date is delayed. Those three provisions, intended to reduce burdens on regulated entities, are the 2018 Requirements' definition of ``research,'' which deems certain activities not to be research, the allowance for no annual continuing review of certain categories of research, and the elimination of the requirement that institutional review boards (IRBs) review grant applications related to the research. The way that this option is proposed, regulated entities would be required to comply with all pre- 2018 Requirements during the period that the general compliance date is delayed, except for provisions substituted by the three burden-reducing provisions of the 2018 Requirements. As described in section III, below, this flexibility is proposed only for studies for which an institution makes a choice to transition to comply with the 2018 Requirements, beginning on July 19, 2018. In order to clearly describe this proposed flexibility, including how it would impact institutions choosing to transition research to comply with the 2018 Requirements, this document proposes a redrafted transition provision.",Proposed Rule,"In a final rule published on January 19, 2017, federal departments and agencies made revisions to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (hereafter the ``2018 Requirements'').

2018-08428,2018-04-20,54,Commerce Department,Patent and Trademark Office,"Request for Comments on Determining Whether a Claim Element Is Well-Understood, Routine, Conventional for Purposes of Subject Matter Eligibility","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) recently issued a decision regarding the inquiry of whether a claim limitation represents well-understood, routine, conventional activities (or elements) to a skilled artisan in the relevant field. Specifically, the Federal Circuit found that whether a claim element, or combination of elements, represents well-understood, routine, conventional activities to a skilled artisan in the relevant field is a question of fact. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has implemented this decision in a memorandum recently issued to the Patent Examining Corps (the Berkheimer memorandum). The Berkheimer memorandum is available to the public on the USPTO's internet website. Examiners had been previously instructed to conclude that an element (or combination of elements) is well-understood, routine, conventional activity only when the examiner can readily conclude that the element(s) is widely prevalent or in common use in the relevant industry. The Berkheimer memorandum now clarifies that such a conclusion must be based upon a factual determination that is supported as discussed in the memorandum. Aditionally the Berkheimer memorandum now also specifies that the analysis for determining whether an element (or combination of elements) is widely prevalent or in common use is the same as the analysis under 35 U.S.C. 112(a) as to whether an element is so well-known that it need not be described in detail in the patent specification.

Specifically, the proposal would modify the current 2 percent leverage buffer, which applies to each GSIB, to equal 50 percent of the firm's GSIB risk-based capital surcharge. The proposal also would require a Board- or OCC-regulated insured depository institution subsidiary of a GSIB to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 3 percent plus 50 percent of the GSIB risk-based surcharge applicable to its top-tier holding company in order to be deemed ``well capitalized'' under the Board's and the OCC's prompt corrective action rules. Consistent with this approach to establishing enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards for insured depository institutions, the OCC is proposing to revise the methodology it uses to identify which national banks and Federal savings associations are subject to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards to ensure that they apply only to those national banks and Federal savings associations that are subsidiaries of a Board-identified GSIB. The Board also is seeking comment on a proposal to make conforming modifications to the GSIB leverage buffer of the Board's total loss- absorbing capacity and long-term debt requirements and other minor amendments to the buffer levels, covered intermediate holding company conformance period, methodology for calculating the covered intermediate holding company long-term debt amount, and external total loss-absorbing capacity risk-weighted buffer.",Proposed Rule,The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are seeking comment on a proposal that would modify the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards for U.S. top-tier bank holding...,DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,treasury-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/treasury-department,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/19/2018-08066/regulatory-capital-rules-regulatory-capital-enhanced-supplementary-leverage-ratio-standards-for-us,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-04-19/pdf/2018-08066.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-08066.pdf?1524055518,https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/497.json,

VA may consider sales, public benefit conveyances, demolition and deconstruction to reduce its unneeded real property. Additionally, VA may consider leases and exchanges to non- Federal entities for potential reuse of vacant and underutilized buildings and structures. This announcement pertains to an alternative process VA may utilize to comply with the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) is a Federal agency tasked with review of other Federal agencies' compliance with NHPA and the implementing regulations. VA intends to request ACHP to consider a Program Comment for the entire program of reduction of vacant and underutilized properties. ACHP may agree or decline to consider VA's Program Comment request. If ACHP does issue a Program Comment in lieu of case-by-case review, this alternative will conserve VA's time, budget and staff resources. It will enable VA to transfer real property rights of the vacant and underutilized properties more quickly while still giving consideration to historic properties as required by NHPA.

The Office is allowed to exclude certain classes of works from this requirement. In a 2010 interim rule, the Office codified its longstanding practice of excluding from the mandatory deposit requirements all electronic works that are not otherwise available in a physical format (i.e., ``electronic works published in the United States and available only online.''). The 2010 interim rule created one exception to this general rule for electronic- only serials, which are subject to mandatory deposit, if they are published in the United States and if they are affirmatively demanded by the Office. On May 17, 2016, the Office published a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on potential regulatory changes that would make the interim rule final and would make electronic-only books and sound recordings subject to mandatory deposit requirements by way of the same demand process. Based on the responses to the NOI and input from the Library, the Office proposes revising its regulations to make the interim rule final, and to make electronic-only books published in the United States subject to the mandatory deposit requirements if they are affirmatively demanded by the Office.

The new system of records, BGFRS-40, will maintain subscription-related information regarding individuals who subscribe to Board publications. The main publication that the Board provides is the Federal Reserve Regulatory Service (FRRS), which is a compilation of the statutes administered by the Board along with regulations, interpretations, policy statements, rulings, and opinions issued by the Board and its staff. The FRRS also includes select regulations issued by other agencies that are relevant to the Board's responsibilities. The Board also provides subscriptions to other publications such as general publications, reports to Congress, and economic research and data. To date, the Board has operated the subscription services itself and stored the data by year rather than by name or personal identifier. Going forward, the Board will contract the subscription services for the FRRS to a vendor, who will maintain the files (both electronic and in paper) in a manner that customarily allows the files to be accessed by name or personal identifier, thus necessitating this new system of records. After the transition of the FRRS subscription services to the vendor, the Board will continue to maintain its old historical FRRS subscription materials for the appropriate record retention period. In addition, the Board will continue to operate the subscription services for the other publications (e.g., the general publications).

We found risks due to emissions of air toxics to be acceptable from this source category, determined that the current standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health, and identified no new cost-effective controls under the technology review to achieve further emissions reductions. Therefore, we are proposing no revisions to the numerical emission limits based on these analyses. However, the EPA is proposing to revise provisions pertaining to emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM); add requirements for electronic submittal of performance test results; revise certain monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements; and make other miscellaneous technical and editorial changes.

2018-06919,2018-04-05,444,Railroad Retirement Board,,"Agency Forms Submitted for OMB Review, Request for Comments","In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is forwarding an Information Collection Request (ICR) to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Our ICR describes the information we seek to collect from the public. Review and approval by OIRA ensures that we impose appropriate paperwork burdens. The RRB invites comments on the proposed collections of information to determine (1) the practical utility of the collections; (2) the accuracy of the estimated burden of the collections; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information that is the subject of collection; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of collections on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Comments to the RRB or OIRA must contain the OMB control number of the ICR. For proper consideration of your comments, it is best if the RRB and OIRA receive them within 30 days of the publication date. 1. Title and purpose of information collection: Railroad Service and Compensation Reports/System Access Application; OMB 3220-0008. Under Section 9 of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and Section 6 of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA), the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) maintains for each railroad employee, a record of compensation paid to that employee by all railroad employers for whom the employee worked after 1936. This record, which is used by the RRB to determine eligibility for, and amount of, benefits due under the laws it administers, is conclusive as to the amount of compensation paid to an employee during such period(s) covered by the report(s) of the compensation by the employee's railroad employer(s), except in cases when an employee files a protest pertaining to his or her reported compensation within the statute of limitations cited in Section 9 of the RRA and Section 6 of the RUIA. To enable the RRB to establish and maintain the record of compensation, employers are required to file with the RRB, reports of their employees' compensation, in such manner and form and at such times as the RRB prescribes. Railroad employers' reports and responsibilities are prescribed in 20 CFR 209. The RRB currently utilizes Form BA-3, Annual Report of Creditable Compensation, and Form BA-4, Report of Creditable Compensation Adjustments, to secure the required information from railroad employers. Form BA-3 provides the RRB with information regarding annual creditable service and compensation for each individual who worked for a railroad employer covered by the RRA and RUIA in a given year. Form BA-4 provides for the adjustment of any previously submitted reports and also the opportunity to provide any service and compensation that had been previously omitted. Requirements specific to Forms BA-3 and BA-4 are prescribed in 20 CFR 209.8 and 209.9. Employers currently have the option of submitting BA-3 and BA-4 reports electronically by CD-ROM, secure Email, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or online via the RRB's Employer Reporting System (ERS). The information collection also includes RRB Form BA-12, Application for Employer Reporting internet Access, and Form G-440, Report Specifications Sheet. Form BA-12 is completed by railroad employers to obtain system access to ERS. Once access is obtained, authorized employees may submit reporting forms online to the RRB. The form determines what degree of access (view/only, data entry/ modification or approval/submission) is appropriate for that employee. It is also used to terminate an employee's access to ERS. Form G-440, Report Specifications Sheet, serves as a certification document for Forms BA-3 and BA-4 as well as other RRB employer reporting forms (Form BA-6a, BA-6 Address Report (OMB 3220-0005), Form BA-9, Report of Separation Allowance or Severance Pay (OMB 3220-0173) and Form BA-11, Report of Gross Earnings (OMB 3220-0132)). It records the type of medium the report was submitted on, and serves as a summary recapitulation sheet for reports filed on paper. Previous Requests for Comments: The RRB has already published the initial 60-day notice (83 FR 3778 on January 26, 2018) required by 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2).

If implemented, this proposed rule would establish new, and revise existing, electronic reporting requirements for federally permitted charter vessels and headboats (for-hire vessels), respectively. This proposed rule would require a charter vessel with a Federal charter vessel/headboat permit for Atlantic CMP, Atlantic dolphin and wahoo, or South Atlantic snapper-grouper species to submit an electronic fishing report weekly, or at shorter intervals if notified by NMFS, through NMFS-approved hardware and software. The proposed rule would also reduce the time allowed for headboats to submit an electronic fishing report.

Chapter 35, as amended) this notice announces the Department of Transportation's (Department) intention to reinstate and partially- modify an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number as related to the Disclosure of Code-Sharing Arrangements and Long-Term Wet Leases. The growth in the use of code-sharing, wet-leasing, and similar marketing tools, particularly in international air transportation, led the Department on March 15, 1999, to adopt specific regulations requiring the disclosure of code-sharing arrangements and long-term wet leases by carriers (U.S. and foreign) and ticket agents via oral, written, and internet communications. In a recent final rule titled ``Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections'' (See, 81 FR 76800, November 3, 2016), the Department, among other things, amended the code-share disclosure regulation to require that carriers and ticket agents must disclose any code-share arrangements on their websites, including mobile websites and applications; clarify the format in which that information must be displayed; and specify that verbal code-share disclosures should be made the first time a flight involving a code- share arrangement is offered to consumers or the first time a consumer inquiries about such a flight whether by telephone or in person conversations.
