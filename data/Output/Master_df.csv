Jordan also denied he had told Lewinsky to falsely denyhaving carried on such an affair. 2) Lewinsky's deposition about her relationswith Clinton has been postponed. Before the delay, reports said she would takethe Fifth Amendment. Now she's said to be interested in negotiating forimmunity from prosecution for perjury and obstruction of justice (i.e., shestill might testify against Clinton) but negotiations have stalled. 3)Circumstantial evidence may corroborate her story, e.g., messenger receiptsallegedly for gifts between her and Clinton, White House logs, and records ofClinton's voice allegedly on her answering machine. 4) Prosecutors havesubpoenaed Betty Currie, Clinton's personal secretary, to seek furthercorroboration. 5) Clinton reportedly admitted in his Paula Jones deposition(see 1/19 item, below) that he fooled around with Gennifer Flowers. Naivecritics concluded that this means Clinton lied in 1992 when he denied havinghad an affair with Flowers. Sophisticated critics conceded he can square hisvarious statements because he's a wizard with weasel words. 6) Paula Jones'attorneys reportedly are investigating whether Clinton had an affair with thewidow of the late Ambassador Larry Lawrence, who got into Arlington Cemeteryevidently because his fake military record wasn't carefully scrutinized.

Whileagreeing that the United States should change the embargo policy, the popeblasted Castro's government for 1) tolerating abortions and divorces; 2)usurping parents' authority to direct their children's education; and 3)substituting ""ideology"" for Christianity.

He bought the deal because thecase against him was a ""slam dunk,"" and he might have got the death penalty.Prosecutors bought the deal because Kaczynski's schizophrenia diagnosis made adeath sentence unlikely.

Neither side said anything new. Vice President Gore gavePresident Clinton credit for saving Roe . Liberal editorialists vouchedfor Roe 's wisdom and lamented its political vulnerability. Conservativeeditorialists vouched for Roe 's political invulnerability and lamentedits unwisdom. Journalists, having planned substantial coverage of the25-year-old Roe case, canceled that date in order to pursue 24-year-oldMonica Lewinsky.

He also attendeda rally at which Jerry Falwell, whose TV show has promoted a video implicatingClinton in murders, spoke. Falwell told Netanyahu in the meeting that he wouldmobilize evangelical churches against those who put pressure on Israel to givethe Palestinians more West Bank territory. Cynics called it a payback foreither 1) Clinton's refusal to meet with Netanyahu recently or 2) Clinton'ssupport for Netanyahu's opponent in the last Israeli election. Clintonreportedly was furious but told Netanyahu they should put past snubs behindthem. Lost in the Falwell story: House Speaker Newt Gingrich called Clinton'streatment of Netanyahu ""below the dignity of the United States.""(1/21)                        Cloningnews: 1) Scientists announced that they have engineered the births oftwo                cloned calves , George and Charlie. The spin: It's acommercial rather than a scientific advance, suggesting that the agricultureand drug industries are capitalizing quickly on cloning technology. 2) The Foodand Drug Administration claimed it has the authority to regulate human cloning.This has led to a dispute between politicians who want to ban human cloning andbiotechnology-industry groups, which think cloning regulation should be left tothe FDA.

The more substantive spin: He popularized the fusion ofblack (rhythm-and-blues and gospel) and white (country) music.(1/21)                        TheIraq crisis is lurching toward military confrontation. First, SaddamHussein threatened to expel U.N. weapons inspectors if the United Nations doesnot lift sanctions within six months. In response, Republican congressionalleaders called for a massive U.S. air assault on Iraq if Saddam does not stopobstructing the inspections. Then Iraq's vice president told Iraqis to reportfor training for a ""holy war"" against the sanctions. The U.S. media are nowfocusing on a military scenario, even as they continue to question its wisdom.(1/19)                        PopeJohn Paul II picked 22 new cardinals . He has now picked 106 of the 123cardinals who will elect the next pope. Analysts agreed that by stacking thiselectorate with conservatives--particularly on questions of sex and birthcontrol--John Paul has guaranteed that his successor will share his views. Thebackspin: The United States and Canada have gained more cardinals, and to woothem, candidates for the papacy will have to be more sensitive to AmericanCatholics' dissent from papal teachings on divorce, remarriage, and women inthe priesthood. (1/19)                        President Clinton gave asix-hour deposition in the Paula Jones case . With Jones ""staring him inthe face,"" he reportedly testified that he hadn't exposed himself to her anddidn't recall meeting her. The media used the deposition as an opportunity topublish additional tales of Clinton's philandering. Jones' lawyers went onseveral TV shows, threatening to raise further allegations in court. Theofficial Clinton spin, from attorney Bob Bennett: silence. The unofficial spin,from James Carville: Jones is a puppet of greedy right-wingers, and besides,Clinton is whipping her in the polls. The 1996 White House spin: Testifying inthe Jones case would wreak havoc on the president's schedule and imperil therepublic. The 1998 spin: The deposition was a minor distraction. Bottom line:This was the worst part for Clinton, so he'll scrap settlement talks andproceed to trial May 27.

The Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes go with Wednesday's effort before the Senate by PresidentClinton's defense team. And the New York Timesand USAToday go with the U.S.' renewed interest in erecting a missile defensesystem.            The papers report that the Clinton lawyers yesterday waged an aggressiveattack on the perjury and obstruction of justice charges lodged against theirclient. The day's arguments are widely seen as a continuation of the Clintonteam's willingness to not only question whether the prosecution's facts mandateimpeachment but also to question the facts themselves. But for the most partthe coverage makes it clear that the weapon of the day was nonetheless not thescalpel but the broad brush.            The papers' consensus star of the day, Clinton attorney Cheryl Mills (thepapers want whenever possible to have heroes and villains and they love newfaces), responded to the House prosecutors' charge that Clinton had violatedPaula Jones' civil rights with what the LAT calls a ""spirited defense""of Clinton's civil rights record, referring along the way to Bill Clinton'sshopkeeper grandfather's penchant for selling to blacks when few whites would.Mills also put her client firmly in the civil rights pantheon of AbrahamLincoln, John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. The WP plays Mills'civil rights salute high, while the NYT puts it atthe very bottom of its account. The LAT also plays it high, but thenlate in its story flatly states that in making this response ""Mills strayedconsiderably from the facts of the case."" And the Post dings Mills forsaying that the Jones case was thrown out without mentioning that the presidentpaid $850,000 to make it go away.            All the papers report that Pat Robertson said Clinton's State of the Unionspeech was a ""home run,"" mooting his impeachment. And they all quote Clintonattorney Gregory Craig's claim that ""if you convict and remove PresidentClinton, then no president of the United States will ever be safe fromimpeachment hearings."" But none of them wonder, Why would we want that?Obviously, impeachment was designed as a sanction that would regulatepresidential conduct, a feature utterly lost if it were to become a deadletter.            The USAT lead flatly states that the Pentagon plans to construct aprimarily ground-based anti-missiledefense system by 2005 and that the next federal budget, due out on Feb. 1,will plan for $10.5 billion spread out over six years for just that purpose.The paper goes on to point out that most of the hardware that would go intosuch a system has never been tested. The NYT says that although thePentagon is sure the new system will be developed, President Clinton has notgiven final approval. And the Times emphasizes not the hardware but thelegal constraints, noting that Clinton last week wrote to Boris Yeltsinbroaching the topic of renegotiating the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty the U.S.and Russia have signed so as to allow the development of the system. Bothstories emphasize that the renewed interest in missile defense has beenprompted by the rather sudden development of long-range missiles by roguestates, such as North Korea. The WP also fronts the story.            Another Rashomon effect is on display in the papers' treatment of AlanGreenspan's congressional testimony yesterday about the just-announced Clintonproposal to allow some Social Security funds to be invested in the stockmarket. The WP calls him ""wary"" and the NYT says he sees a""possible threat."" Meanwhile, USAT says he ""opposes"" it and theLAT says he ""assails"" it.            The Wall Street Journal front-page news box and the LATfront report that a California jury has ordered the insurance company Aetna topay $116 million in punitive damages for refusing to cover an experimentaltreatment for a patient who later died. The papers say the award is anothersign that the public feels health care companies are too bottom-lineoriented.            Inside USAT is a great example of a piece that gets beyond theoft-repeated facts. It's a commonplace now that the Brady Bill has keptthousands of guns out of the hands of felons. But it turns out, reports thepaper, none of the more than 13,000 people (mostly convicted felons)stopped so far from buying guns by the FBI's recently instituted instantbackground check has been arrested, even though trying to buy a gun by lyingabout one's background is a federal crime.

3,ZVF79KELA3U4.OM9Y2FO8RV241@mimefactory.state.tld,"is. Then you hear a ""public-service announcement"" of the",2018-01-01T17:47:14,Normal,"                                 Bill Clinton Wants <I>You</I> on Welfare!            President Clinton ended the welfare program called Aid to Families withDependent Children (AFDC) in 1996. Since then, caseloads in the main federalwelfare program, now known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF),have fallen to less than half their previous levels. Clinton reminds us of thisat every opportunity, as well he should. His major political achievement hasbeen cleansing the Democrats of their previous, not-unjustified image as thepro-dole party.            So could Clinton now really be pushing people back onto the dole? In a smallbut significant way, the answer is yes. The announcement was buried in thepresident's weekly radio address of Dec. 4. After boasting, ""We've changed theculture of welfare from one that fostered dependence to one that honors andrewards work,"" Clinton unveiled three new ""high-performance bonuses""--extramoney that will be used as a carrot to induce states to do certain things. Onewill reward states that get more poor children into two-parent families. (Noproblem there.) One will reward states that enroll more poor children inMedicaid. (Good idea!) But a third will reward states that show the biggest""improvement in the percentage of low income families eligible for Food Stampswho get them.""*            That one seems like a really bad idea.            Why? Clinton's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which proposedthe regulations implementing the new food-stamp bonuses, saysthey will promote the goal of ""ending the dependence of needy parents ongovernment benefits."" But wait a minute. The proposed bonus tries to get statesto go out and sign more people up for government benefits--namely foodstamps.            And food stamps are a peculiar benefit, in that, if you have children, youcan get them whether or not you work. Indeed, you can make no attempt to evenfind a job or support your family, and you'll still qualify for $230 a month infood stamps (for a two-person family) or $329 (for a three-person family) or$419 (for four). In southern states, this food-stamp benefit typically exceedsthe regular monthly TANF benefit. Food stamps are also fungible--although thestamps can be used only to buy food, they work just like cash. You buy foodwith them as if they were cash; they are traded informally as if they werecash.            There is a word for cashlike benefits you can get whether you work or not.The word is welfare. Pushing food stamps on poor people is unlikely to movepeople off of welfare because food stamps are welfare. As a veteranliberal welfare expert told me, upon hearing of the new bonus, it's ""perverseto say we want you to move people to self-sufficiency and then say we want youto sign them up for more welfare.""            Because food stamps are a form of welfare, they--like AFDC and TANFbenefits--have traditionally been stigmatized, even among those who areeligible to get them. This stigma is the natural flip side of the work ethic:If you ""honor and support work,"" in Clinton's phrase, then you are at leastslightly dishonored and ashamed to get a handout that goes to people who don'twork a lick. Low-income workers, especially, have been reluctant to sign up forthe benefits to which they are legally entitled. As noted by HHS, ""only 39percent of individuals with earnings who are eligible for food stamps benefitsparticipate in the Food Stamp Program, compared to a participation rate of 71percent overall."" Some of those who don't claim their benefits may be less-poorworkers whose small food-stamp allotment isn't worth the hassle of applying.But many are undoubtedly people who are simply proud that they don't depend ona handout. It's hard to deny that this pride is, in some sense, a goodthing.            Clinton's new plan in effect dismisses the food-stamp stigma as an archaicrelic. This represents a small but telling victory for those Democrats--I callthem Money Liberals--for whom getting cash to the poor, not upholding the workethic, is the most important thing. Since the 1996 reform, their centralstrategy--promoted, most importantly, by Wendell Primus and Robert Greensteinof the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities--has been to destigmatize oldwelfare programs such as food stamps by repackaging them as ""work supports""that can boost the incomes of the millions leaving welfare for low-payingjobs.            Sure enough, Clinton declared food stamps ""critical supports,"" and vowed to""hold states accountable and make sure families get the benefits they need."" Toqualify for a bonus under his new regulations, states would be required notjust to make it easy for families who leave welfare (TANF) to keep getting foodstamps, but to actively ""encourage food stamp applications even if the TANFapplication halts."" In effect, states would be saying, ""Sign up! It's good toget food stamps."" Stigma, schmigma!            Maybe I'm overreacting, but I think Clinton is courting disaster here. Whilefood stamps might help support some welfare mothers during a transitionalperiod between TANF and pure self-sufficiency, removing the food-stamp stigmarisks encouraging a far greater number to become dependent in the first place.Suppose you're a single mom working at the Gap. You're proud not to be onwelfare. You don't even know where the welfare office is. Then you hear a""public-service announcement"" of the sort the new HHS regulations encourage. Ittells you that food stamps are respectable, that you're a fool not to go downand claim what you're entitled to. So you find out where the welfare office is,and there you also learn that if you quit your job you can qualify for twoyears of TANF welfare. If you go on TANF, and then later go back to work at theGap, you get to keep not only food stamps but a bit of your welfare check too.Hmmm. Sounds appealing.            Or worse, you're a young girl who's just graduated from high school. You'venever had a job. Why not have a kid out of wedlock, collect your $230 a monthin stamps, live with your mom and worry about going to work later? Food stampsare OK! They're good! The government says so.            True, the Clinton administration is trying to say that food stampsare really good only if you're also working at least part-time, but that's kindof a complicated message to get across. One deterrent to food-stamp use,remember, is the Checkout-Line Factor--people tend to look at you funny whenyou whip out your food-stamp card to buy your groceries. If food stamps aredestigmatized, though, nobody will look at you funny--even if you really aren'tworking at all. The sales pitch designed to ""support"" workers will also protectshirkers. In practice, how could the government hope to destigmatize foodstamps for the former group but not for the latter group (who are, under law,also entitled to them)?            How did the welfare culture grow in the first place? It happened in the late1960s, when state and local officials embarked on a campaign to encouragewelfare and food-stamp use--to remove stigma and boost ""participation rates.""The result? A tripling of the welfare rolls. This ""welfare explosion"" wasn'tundone until the 1996 reform sent the opposite message. Now Clinton risksreversing, at least partially, the actual, practical process that brought himthe caseload declines he's crowing about today. Will he be happy when the rollsfor food stamps and TANF start to rise again?            The arguments the administration now makes about food stamps, of course, caneasily be made about basic welfare--TANF--too. Can't it, too, provide a""critical support"" for those who've just gone to work but don't earn enough tomake it all the way out of poverty? Shouldn't we encourage those people to stayon welfare, albeit at a lower benefit level, rather than make a harsh, cleanbreak? Don't they ""need"" an ongoing TANF check to ""complete the transition toself-sufficiency,"" as HHS puts it? You say food stamps are different becausethey are ""nutritional""? Don't babies need clothes as well as food?            In fact, these arguments are already being made by Money Liberals around thecountry. The next campaign, once TANF and food stamps have been redefined asrespectable ""work supports,"" will be to make those benefits more generous. Butin a welfare program, the same benefit levels apply to workers and non-workersalike. If benefits are raised, it will be increasingly possible for at leastsome part of the population to piece together enough ""work supports"" to live onthe supports without the work. Not to live well, of course, but theproblem of dependency has never been about people living well.            Clinton seems to be ignoring one of the hard-won lessons of liberalism'scollapse, which is that programs to help poor workers should actually berestricted to workers. These ""work-tested"" programs make society's values(i.e., the work ethic) unmistakably clear. Not coincidentally, theseprograms--including unemployment compensation, Social Security, and the EarnedIncome Tax Credit (EITC), all of which you have to work to get--have beenpolitically unassailable, while welfare programs are either unpopular oractively despised. And when a benefit is restricted to workers, Congress canmake it more generous without the risk of creating a culture of dependency.            If the administration wants to get more money to the working poor--as itshould--why not do it through measures restricted to the working poor, like anexpanded EITC and a higher minimum wage, rather than through food stamps? Untilthen, if working-poor people think they need food stamps and want to claimthem, fine--the states shouldn't make that difficult (as some, allegedly, havedone). But if a working-poor American sees food stamps as an undignifiedhandout, that judgment, too, deserves respect. The government shouldn't make ita goal to push benefits onto people who think food stamps are welfare byanother name. They're right, after all.                           * If you read the fine print, the ""bonus,"" which amounts to $20 million,is to go to the states that show the greatest ""improvement"" in the percent oflow-income working families receiving food stamps. Thatrestriction doesn't save the plan, however. The working poor are the group ofeligible recipients who are most likely to stigmatize the receipt of welfare.They are a key group we don't want to slip into dependence. And removing thestigma for them is likely to remove it for everyone, including the non-workerswho remain eligible for food stamps.

4,ZVF79KELA3U4.UGGYUY945VJQ@mimefactory.state.tld,"between Welsh and Witt, The Thin Red Line",2018-01-01T03:32:16,Normal,"                                 War and Pieces            No movie in the last decadehas succeeded in psyching out critics and audiences as fully as the powerful,rambling war epic The Thin Red Line , Terrence Malick's return to cinemaafter 20 years. I've sat through it twice and am still trying to sort out myresponses, which run from awe to mockery and back. Like Saving PrivateRyan , the picture wallops you in the gut with brilliant, splattery battlemontages and Goyaesque images of hell on earth. But Malick, a certifiedintellectual and the Pynchonesque figure who directed Badlands andDays                of                Heaven in the 1970s and then disappeared, is in adifferent philosophical universe from Steven Spielberg. Post-carnage, hissundry characters philosophize about their experiences in drowsy, runicvoice-overs that come at you like slow bean balls: ""Why does nature vie withitself? ... Is there an avenging power in nature, not one power but two?"" Or""This great evil: Where's it come from? What seed, what root did it grow from?Who's doin' this? Who's killin' us, robbin' us of life and light?"" First youget walloped with viscera, then you get beaned by blather.            Those existentialspeculations don't derive from the screenplay's source, an archetypal butotherwise down-to-earth 1962 novel by James Jones (who also wrote From Hereto Eternity ) about the American invasion of the South Pacific island ofGuadalcanal. They're central to Malick's vision of the story, however, and notspecious. In the combat genre, the phrase ""war is hell"" usually means nothingmore than that it's a bummer to lose a limb or two, or to see your buddy gethis head blown off. A true work of art owes us more than literal horrors, andMalick obliges by making his theater of war the setting for nothing less than ameditation on the existence of God.            He tells the story solemnly, in three parts, with abig-deal cast (Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack) and a few other major stars(John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney) dropping by for cameos. Afteran Edenic prelude, in which a boyishly idealistic absent without leave soldier,Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel), swims with native youths to the accompaniment of aheavenly children's choir, the first part sees the arrival of the Allied forceson the island, introduces the principal characters (none of whom amounts to agenuine protagonist), and lays out the movie's geographical and philosophicalterrain. The centerpiece--the fighting--goes on for over an hour and featuresthe most frantic and harrowing sequences, chiefly the company's initiallyunsuccessful frontal assault on a Japanese hilltop bunker. The coda lastsnearly 40 minutes and is mostly talk and cleanup, the rhythms growing morerelaxed until a final, incongruous spasm of violence--whereupon the survivingsoldiers pack their gear and motor off to another South Pacific battle. In thefinal shot, a twisted tree grows on the waterline of the beach, the cycle oflife beginning anew.                           The Thin RedLine has a curious sound-scape, as the noise of battle frequently recedesto make room for interior monologues and Hans Zimmer's bump-bump, minimalistNew Age music. Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin) talks to his curvy, redheaded wife,viewed in deliriously sensual flashbacks. (""Love: Where does it come from? Wholit this flame in us?"") Lt. Col. Tall (Nolte), a borderline lunatic passed overone too many times for promotion and itching to win a battle no matter what thehuman cost, worries groggily about how his men perceive him. The dreamer Wittposes folksy questions about whether we're all a part of one big soul. If themovie has a spine, it's his off-and-on dialogue with Sgt. Welsh (Penn), who'sincreasingly irritated by the private's beatific, almost Billy Budd-likeoptimism. Says Welsh, ""In this world, a man himself is nothin', and there ain'tno world but this one."" Replies Witt, high cheekbones glinting, ""I seen anotherworld."" At first it seems as if Witt will indeed be Billy Budd to Welsh'svindictive Claggart. But if Witt is ultimately an ethereal martyr, Welsh turnsout to be a Bogart-like romantic who can't stop feeling pain in the face of anabsent God. He speaks the movie's epitaph, ""Darkness and light, strife andlove: Are they the workings of one mind, the feature of the same face? O mysoul, let me be in you now. Look out through my eyes. Look out at the thingsyou made, all things shining.""            Malick puts a lot of shining things on the screen:soldiers, natives, parrots, bats, rodents, visions of Eden by way ofNational Geographic and of the Fall by way of Alpo. Malick's conceptionof consciousness distributes it among the animate and inanimate alike; almostevery object is held up for rapturous contemplation. I could cite hundreds ofimages: A soldier in a rocking boat hovers over a letter he's writing, which iscrammed from top to bottom and side to side with script. (You don't know theman, but you can feel in an instant his need to cram everything in.) A small,white-bearded Melanesian man strolls nonchalantly past a platoon of tenselytrudging grunts who can't believe they're encountering this instead of ahail of Japanese bullets. Two shots bring down the first pair of soldiers toadvance on the hill; a second later, the sun plays mystically over the tall,yellow grass that has swallowed their bodies. John Toll's camera rushes in on acaptured Japanese garrison: One Japanese soldier shrieks; another, skeletal,laughs and laughs; a third weeps over a dying comrade. The face of a Japanesesoldier encased in earth speaks from the dead, ""Are you righteous? Know that Iwas, too.""            Whether or not these pearllike epiphanies arestrung is another matter. Malick throws out his overarching theme--isnature two-sided, at war with itself?--in the first few minutes but, for allhis startling juxtapositions, he never dramatizes it with anything approachingthe clarity of, say, Brian De Palma's Casualties of War (1989). Besidesthe dialogue between Welsh and Witt, The Thin Red Line 's otherorganizing story involves a wrenching tug of war between Nolte'sambition-crazed Tall and Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas), who refuses an order tosend his men on what will surely be a suicidal--and futile--assault on abunker. But matters of cause and effect don't really interest Malick.Individual acts of conscience can and do save lives, and heroism can win a waror a battle, he acknowledges. But Staros is ultimately sent packing, and Malicknever bothers to trace the effect of his action on the Guadalcanal operation.In fact, the entire battle seems to take place in a crazed void. Tall quotesHomer's ""rosy-fingered dawn"" and orders a meaningless bombardment to ""buck themen up--it'll look like the Japs are catching hell."" Soldiers shoot at hazyfigures, unsure whether they're Japanese or American. Men collide, blowthemselves in half with their own mishandled grenades, stab themselvesfrantically with morphine needles, shove cigarettes up their noses to keep thestench of the dying and the dead at bay. A tiny bird, mortally wounded,flutters in the grass.            Malick is convincing--attimes overwhelming--on the subject of chaos. It's when he tries to ruminate onorder that he gets gummed up, retreating to one of his gaseous multiplemouthpieces: ""Where is it that we were together? Who is it that I lived with?Walked with? The brother. ... The friend. ... One mind."" I think I'd have aneasier time with Malick's metaphysical speculations if I had a sense of someconcomitant geopolitical ones--central to any larger musings on forces ofnature as viewed through the prism of war. Couldn't it be that the German andJapanese fascist orders were profoundly anti-natural, and that the Allies'cause was part of a violent but natural correction? You don't have to buy intoSpielberg's Lincolnesque pieties in Saving Private Ryan to believe thatthere's a difference between World War II and Vietnam (or, for that matter,World War II and the invasion of Grenada or our spats with Iraq). While he wasat Harvard, Malick might have peeled himself off the lap of his pointy-headedmentor, Stanley Cavell, the philosopher and film theorist, and checked out afew of Michael Waltzer's lectures on just and unjust wars. Maybe then he'd viewGuadalcanal not in an absurdist vacuum (the soldiers come, they kill and arekilled, they leave) but in the larger context of a war that was among the mostrational (in its aims, if not its methods) fought in the last severalcenturies. For all his visionary filmmaking, Malick's Zen neutrality sometimesseems like a cultivated--and pretentious--brand of fatuousness.            John Travolta's empty nightclub impersonation of BillClinton in Primary Colors (1998) had one positive result: It gave him ajump-start on Jan Schlichtmann, the reckless personal injury lawyer at thecenter of A Civil Action . Travolta's Schlichtmann is much more redolentof Clinton: slick and selfish and corrupt in lots of ways but basically on theside of the angels, too proud and arrogant to change tactics when all iscertainly lost. Schlichtmann pursued--and more or less blew--a civil liabilitycase against the corporate giants Beatrice and W.R. Grace over the allegedlycarcinogenic water supply of Woburn, Mass. Boston writer Jonathan Harr, in thebook the movie is based on, went beyond the poison in the Woburn wells to evoke(stopping just short of libel) the poison of the civil courts, where platoonsof overpaid corporate lawyers can drive opponents with pockets less deep andpsyches less stable into bankruptcy and hysteria.            Director StevenZaillian's version doesn't capture the mounting rage that one experiences whilereading Harr's book, or even the juicy legal machinations that Francis FordCoppola giddily manipulated in his underrated adaptation of John Grisham'sThe Rainmaker (1997). But A Civil Action is a sturdy piece ofwork, an old-fashioned conversion narrative with some high-tech zip.Schlichtmann doesn't take this ""orphan"" case--brought by the parents of severalchildren who died of leukemia--because he wants to do good but because hefigures that Grace and Beatrice will fork over huge sums of money to keep theparents from testifying publicly about their children's last days. He mightsucceed, too, if it weren't for Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall), the Beatricelawyer who knows how to keep Schlichtmann shadowboxing while his small firm'sfinancial resources dwindle to nothing.            Zaillian is at his most assured when he cuts back and forthbetween Facher's Harvard Law School lectures on what not to do in courtand Schlichtmann's fumbling prosecution. The sequence has the extra dimensionof good journalism: It dramatizes and comments simultaneously. Plus, it givesDuvall a splendid platform for impish understatement. (Duvall has become morefun to watch than just about anyone in movies.) Elsewhere, Zaillian takes amore surface approach, sticking to legal minutiae and rarely digging for thedeeper evil. As in his Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), the outcomeof every scene is predictable, but how Zaillian gets from beat to beat issurprisingly fresh. He also gets sterling bit performances from Sydney Pollackas the spookily sanguine Grace CEO, William H. Macy as Schlichtmann's rabbityaccountant, and Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of one of the victims. Quinlanknows that when you're playing a woman who has lost a child you don't need toemote--you reveal the emotion by trying not to emote.            To the families involved in the Woburn tragedy, thereal climax of this story isn't the downbeat ending of the book or the sleightof hand, ""let's call the Environmental Protection Agency,"" upbeat ending of themovie. The climax is the publication of a book that takes the plaintiffs' sideand that remains on the best-seller list in hardcover and paperback for years.The climax is the movie starring John Travolta. Beatrice and Grace made out OKlegally, but some of us will never use their products again without thinkingabout Travolta losing his shirt in the name of those wasted-away littlekids.

Could it be because I amtreasuring 1275 messages in my inbox? Anyway, I will just send off into theblue my thoughts on seeing Peter Kurth, brother of Barbara Kurth, on GoodMorning America (I think). You'll remember that Barbara Kurth is the motherwhose daughters were kidnapped by her ex-husband, Stephen Fagan, who changedhis name and lived in shadowy splendor in Palm Beach Florida, raising ""thegirls"" as they are always called (they're now 21 and 23), having told themtheir mother died in a car crash. Barbara Kurth got no help from FBI or legalsystem in tracking him down, by the way, because the kidnapping took place inl979, before parental kidnapping was covered by appropriate laws. She spent allher money on private eyes, to no avail.            So of course, since she is the mother, Barbara Kurth has been attacked inthe media, solely on the basis of allegations by Stephen Fagan, who says shewas an alcoholic who neglected the children, leaving him no choice. (She denieshis charge--which was investigated by the court, after all, which found themuntrue and gave her custody.) He doesn't explain why he kept up the deceptionfor two decades, long after his ex-wife had clearly overcome her problems ifshe ever had any, and had gotten a Ph.D. (she is now a professor of cellbiology, married--but no kids). His whole family was in on it, too--his parentsalso moved to Florida. It's hard to imagine the cruelty involved here.            Anyway, I turn on the TV in my hotel room in Whittier California, whichis--as every single person I mentioned this place to reminded me--where Nixonwent to college (why do we all have this little fact so firmly implanted in ourbrains?), and there was Barbara Kurth's brother, Peter, being interviewed byKatie Couric.

We received the rules on March 16, 1998. They werepublished in the Federal Register as final rules on March 23, 1998.63 Fed. Reg. 13916 and 13968.The Registration Form final rule amends Form N-1A which is usedby mutual funds to register under the Investment Company Act of1940 and to offer their shares under the Securities Act of 1933.The final rule is intended to improve fund prospectus disclosureand to promote more effective communication of information aboutfunds to investors by focusing the disclosure on essentialinformation. This will assist investors in deciding whether toinvest. Disclosure about technical, legal, and operational mattersthat are common to all funds is minimized.The New Disclosure Option final rule permits a mutual fund tooffer investors a new disclosure document called a ""Aprofile,""which summarizes key informationGAO/OGC-98-40about a fund's investment strategies, risks, performance, andfees in a concise, standardized format. Investors have the optionof purchasing the fund's shares after reviewing the profile orafter requesting and reviewing the fund's prospectus. An investordeciding to purchase shares based on the information in a profilewill receive a prospectus with confirmation of the purchase.Enclosed is our assessment of the SEC's compliance with theprocedural steps required by section 801(a)(1)(B)(i) through (iv)of title 5 with respect to the rules. Our review indicates that theSEC complied with the applicable requirements.If you have any questions about this report, please contactJames Vickers, Assistant General Counsel, at (202) 512-8210.

The actrequires the SEC to consider whether its rulemaking will promoteefficiency, competition, and capital formation.The analysis for the Registration Form rule notes that while itis difficult to quantify costs and benefits, the total annual costof $175 million for preparing, filing, and updating the currentForm N-1A is not expected to rise significantly because newinformation is not required. The benefits of the new rule includemore wellinformed investors who may invest more of their resourcesand allocate their investments carefully, which in turn would tendto promote competition among the funds.The analysis for the New Disclosure Option rule also notes thedifficulty of quantifying the costs and benefits of the rule. TheSEC has estimated that the annual cost to the industry of preparingand filing updated profiles would be approximately $5.6 million,which may be offset by restructured advertising expenditures andlower printing and distribution costs. One benefit is bettermeeting the diverse information needs of investors in evaluatingfunds, which has become more difficult as the number of funds hasgrown.(ii) Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act,5 U.S.C.  603-605, 607, and 609An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and a FinalRegulatory Flexibility Analysis were prepared for both rules andwere summarized in the preambles to the proposed and final rules,respectively. The complete analyses were furnished to our Office.The analyses contain the information required by the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.The Final Analysis for the Registration Form rule notes that ofthe approximately 2,700 registered open-end management investmentcompanies, approximately 620 orGAO/OGC-98-4023 percent are funds which meet the definition of small entitieswith net assets of $50 million or less at the end of the mostrecent fiscal year. The analysis concludes that the final rule willnot impose any additional burdens on small entities because most ofthe changes in the rule do not require the development of newinformation. The rule will primarily require a reformatting of thecurrent information, which may take longer the initial time it isperformed but will possibly result in less time in the future forpreparing the new format. While it considered several alternativesto reduce to the burden on small entities, the SEC found thatseparate treatment for small entities would not be consistent withthe protection of investors.Concerning the New Disclosure Option rule, the Final Analysisnotes that approximately one-third of the 620 small entities couldchoose to use the new profile or 207 funds. The analysis finds thatthe new rule would not be significantly burdensome for smallentities because use of the profile is optional and that theinformation contained in the profile is now typically contained afund's prospectus. As above, while several alternatives wereconsidered, the SEC found that it was unnecessary or inappropriateto adopt any of them because of the need for investorprotection.(iii) Agency actions relevant to sections 202-205 of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C.  1532-1535As an independent regulatory agency, the SEC is not subject totitle II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.(iv) Other relevant information or requirements under acts andexecutive ordersAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  551 et seq.Both final rules were issued using the notice and commentprocedures contained in 5 U.S.C.  553.The Registration Form rule was published as a Notice of ProposedRulemaking on March 10, 1997 (62 Fed. Reg. 10898) and 78 commentswere received in response to the notice. The New Disclosure Optionrule was published as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the sameday (62 Fed.

But the bigger problem is that even $3,575",2018-01-01T23:50:38,Normal,"                                 Policy Corner: Bush Ed            The reviews of George W. Bush's proposal for educationreform, unveiled three weeks ago in California, have been largely favorable.Sober-minded columnists and education reformers have praised the plan, whichhinges on taking federal money away from failing schools and giving it toparents to use elsewhere. But the analysis has neglected one salient pointabout the Bush program: It already exists in Texas. And it's a failure.            Under Bush's proposal, states would be required to testtheir ""disadvantaged"" students on academic basics every year. If a school'stest scores didn't improve after three consecutive years, the federalgovernment would take away its contribution that comes under an aid programknown as Title 1. This federal money would then go to parents, who could use itas a voucher to pay for a private school, tutoring, or another publicschool--""for whatever offers hope,"" as Bush put it. In announcing the plan, heestimated that the Title1 chit would be worth about $1,500 per student.            You can find the details of how something similaractually works in W. country in a Sept. 3 HoustonChronicle story by Melanie Markley and Kathy Walt. Under a program thatBush has promoted (but did not initiate), Texas tests all its students andschools just as he envisions doing nationally. Students have to take the TexasAssessment of Academic Skills (TAAS). On the basis of that test and a few otherfactors, schools are rated in one of four categories: ""low-performing,""""acceptable,"" ""recognized,"" or ""exemplary."" Only one school in the entirestate--Goodrich Elementary School, 60 miles outside Houston--has been rated""low-performing"" for three consecutive years. What would happen to Goodrichunder the Bush plan? This school, which has 150 students, gets only $47,000 inTitle 1 funds each year. This means that parents would receive a voucher worthnot $1,500 per student, but $313.33. That doesn't buy a lot of hope, even inGoodrich, Texas. In fact, there are no private schools in the vicinity, whichmeans that there wouldn't even be anyone to turn down this sorry-assed excusefor tuition.            What about urban districts? It so happens that Houstonhas a program that is both more generous and more stringent than Bush'sproposal. It says that students who fail the Texas test and who attend schoolsrated ""low-performing"" by the state for just one year, can receive a credit of$3,575 to attend private school. It's not exactly a voucher, since the schooldistrict negotiates directly with private schools to place these students. Thisyear,147 students in the Houston Independent School District qualify to opt outof failing public schools under this program. How many have taken advantage ofit? Zero.            The Chronicle story offersa couple of explanations for this. For one thing, the Houston school districtdidn't identify which students qualified for the program until August, by whichtime it was too late to enroll elsewhere for this year. But the bigger problemis that even $3,575 isn't enough to pay tuition at a private school in Houston.Four or five private schools did contact the school district to expressinterest in the program, but all considered a payment of $3,600 too low.Tuition at run-of-the-mill private schools in Houston runs more like $5,500 forthe school year. At elite academies, it can be as much as $12,000 per year.Since the Chronicle story was published, oneprivate school has agreed to accept 25 students. It's a mostly African-Americanreligious school, which intends to create a separate secular facility for thepublic-school transfer students.            If private schools in Houston won't accept a $3,600voucher, it's pretty clear that a $1,500 voucher won't produce any real choicefor parents. And if there's no choice, there's no competitive pressure onfailing public schools, which is the chief justification for the program. Tofind out whether vouchers can actually improve education, Bush would have tooffer an additional incentive worth several times the federal government'sTitle 1 spending (currently around $8 billion). But even the compassionate oneisn't prepared to run afoul of conservative dogma to the extent of proposingspending tens of billions of additional federal dollars on education.            The Texas story points to another fatal flaw in Bush'sproposal. How is it that only one school in the whole state of Texas has beenrated ""low-performing"" for three consecutive years? Bush might have you believethat it's because he has done so much to improve education in Texas. In fact,it's because the state standards are riddled with loopholes. Schools can exemptstudents judged to have learning disabilities, or who have limited Englishskills, from taking the state test. Schools do this--and the state permitsit--to avoid punishment and embarrassment. It's the bureaucratic equivalent ofsocial promotion. How likely is it that states would set up stringent systemsof evaluation and accountability for the sake of having their federal educationfunding taken away? Not very. Bush is proposing that federal education dollarscome with strings attached. But the people receiving the dollars get to pullthe strings.            There's a way around this problem: set federaleducation standards. Reading at a fourth-grade level should mean the same thingin Goodrich, Texas, that it does in Bismarck, N.D. With a single standard, youcould measure any school against any other school and truly assess theirprogress or failure against a common baseline. Checker Finn and Diane Ravich,two of Bush's education advisers, have championed this idea in the past. YetBush's plan steers entirely clear of national standards in favor of state ones.The implicit reason is, once again, that anything the federal government doesruns afoul of the conservative dogma, which says that education is anexclusively local responsibility.            More money and strict federal standards would makeBush's plan plausible and interesting. Until his work improves, he deserves aD.

Could it be because I amtreasuring 1275 messages in my inbox? Anyway, I will just send off into theblue my thoughts on seeing Peter Kurth, brother of Barbara Kurth, on GoodMorning America (I think). You'll remember that Barbara Kurth is the motherwhose daughters were kidnapped by her ex-husband, Stephen Fagan, who changedhis name and lived in shadowy splendor in Palm Beach Florida, raising ""thegirls"" as they are always called (they're now 21 and 23), having told themtheir mother died in a car crash. Barbara Kurth got no help from FBI or legalsystem in tracking him down, by the way, because the kidnapping took place inl979, before parental kidnapping was covered by appropriate laws. She spent allher money on private eyes, to no avail.            So of course, since she is the mother, Barbara Kurth has been attacked inthe media, solely on the basis of allegations by Stephen Fagan, who says shewas an alcoholic who neglected the children, leaving him no choice. (She denieshis charge--which was investigated by the court, after all, which found themuntrue and gave her custody.) He doesn't explain why he kept up the deceptionfor two decades, long after his ex-wife had clearly overcome her problems ifshe ever had any, and had gotten a Ph.D. (she is now a professor of cellbiology, married--but no kids). His whole family was in on it, too--his parentsalso moved to Florida. It's hard to imagine the cruelty involved here.            Anyway, I turn on the TV in my hotel room in Whittier California, whichis--as every single person I mentioned this place to reminded me--where Nixonwent to college (why do we all have this little fact so firmly implanted in ourbrains?), and there was Barbara Kurth's brother, Peter, being interviewed byKatie Couric.

This is also the top international newsstory at the Los Angeles Times , which leads instead with word thatbilingual education continues to thrive in California's public schools despitepassage this year of a statewide initiative substantially restricting it.            The big peace talk development yesterday, the papers report, is thatBenjamin Netanyahu warned Yasser Arafat that he would take his delegation homeif his country's West Bank security demands were not met. The most pressingdemands appear to be for the Palestinians to repeal the PLO charter's provisioncalling for the destruction of Israel, and to turn over to the Israelis anumber of suspected terrorists. The NYT , WP , and LATreport that things had unwound so much that the Israel delegation had packedtheir bags and some of their luggage was transferred to the airport.            It's not clear from the coverage why the Israelis didn't make good on theirthreat. The NYT quotes an American official saying it was just theIsraelis' ""childish ploy,"" intended for domestic Israeli consumption. TheLAT notes that both settlers and the right wing of Netanyahu's own partyare warning him not to roll over. The WP cites this factor and addsanother: Netanyahu, who is inclined toward GOP sentiments, knows how much abreakthrough before the congressional elections would mean to Bill Clinton, andhence wants to deny him this success. This American political angle is veryprominent in the WP reporting, which says flatly that Clinton wants adeal far more than the participants he's hosting do. At one point, theLAT makes a bathetic and rather yuppyish reference to Clinton's role,saying that thus far, he has ""invested more than 55 hours"" in the summit talks.Do you think the papers ever wrote about Ralph Bunche or Dag Hammarskold as ifthey billed by the hour?            The USAT runs a front-pager reporting that as part of thejust-concluded budget agreement, U.S. researchers will receive $23 million tocontinue work on a drug-eating fungus that could destroy opium poppies and cocaplants. A congressman who co-sponsored the funding says that the technologyshould be finished in about a year.            A Wall Street Journal feature makes the point that theBorder Patrol, the unit of the INS that most directly polices the Mexicanborder, is no longer just Anglos. Currently, 38 percent of the patrol's rank-and-file officers are Hispanic.This is a result of the INS' beefing up of its Operation Gatekeeper, whichtargets illegal entries from Mexico into the San Diego area. The expandedhiring recruited heavily from southwestern border states and emphasized fluencyin Spanish. The Hispanic agents often come in for special pleading in Spanishand failing that, special abuse, from those they detain.            The WP front features the surprisingly successful Minnesota gubernatorial candidacy of Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura, alibertarian former professional wrestler, bodyguard, Navy Seal and talk showhost. Ventura has, reports the paper, stimulated the electorate with anunpackaged campaign the likes of which have not been seen since early Perot.Before dismissing Ventura as any kind of a stereotype, consider his response toa question about his stance on gay rights: ""I have two friends that have beentogether 41 years. If one of them becomes sick the other one is not evenallowed to be at the bedside. I don't believe government should be so hostile,so mean-spirited....Love is bigger than government.""            Both the NYT and LAT fronts feature stories about so-called""smart guns"" that can only be fired when held by thedesignated shooter, because of a distance-sensitive transponding device such asa finger ring. The guns could, the papers write, unify both sides of the gundebate in that they promise to boost gun sales for manufacturers developingthem, while reducing accidental shootings by children and ""take-away"" shootingsof cops. But, notes the NYT , there are still concerns: a government testhas found that there are reliability problems, many due to limitations ofbattery life, and even if perfected, the technology would make no dent in gunsuicide by rightful gun owners, or in the gun deaths lurking in the form of allthe ""dumb"" guns already out there.

USAT and the Post note that the latest round of Starrsubpoenas, supported by an appeals court decision last week impugning thenotion of ""protective privilege,"" targets agents with far more intimateknowledge of presidential behavior and movements than the uniformed SecretService personnel previously interviewed. Because the DOJ is expected tocontest the subpoenas, the agents' compelled testimony, says USAT , isnot expected anytime soon. Both the LAT and the NYT put thedevelopment deep inside. Odd discrepancy: the WP says seven agents weresubpoenaed while USAT says five.            Pictures from Northern Ireland of little coffins get lots of front space allaround.

In Yediot Aharanot ,",2018-01-01T23:59:47,Normal,"                                 Israel Grieves            A wave of emotion swept theworld's press Monday following the death of King Hussein of Jordan, but nowheremore than in Israel. Maariv carried a huge picture of him under theheadline ""Shalom, King,"" while Yediot Aharanot printed in Hebrew andArabic the words ""Shalom to a friend."" Eitan Haber, an aide to the late IsraeliPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, wrote in Yediot Aharanot , ""If they lay athousand flowers on your grave, one will be mine. ... If a thousand tears soakyour final resting place, one will drip from my eyes. ... I want to thank you,first and foremost, for the peace. And I have no doubt that Yitzhak Rabin joinsin these warm thanks. He is waiting for you with a soldier's handshake.""            In Maariv , ChemiShalev also dwelt on the king's relationship with Rabin: ""They were sodifferent, these two, yet they were very close. An introvert and impatientgeneral and a noble and generous monarch, whose objectives and souls joined.""He imagined them ""up there"" together, lighting cigarettes for each other andtalking old soldiers' talk. Also in Maariv , Yosef Lapid wrote thatHussein might have made two grave mistakes--in 1967 when he joined Egypt'sabortive attempt to destroy Israel, and in 1990 when he supported SaddamHussein's invasion of Kuwait--but he was nevertheless ""the only Arab leaderIsraeli citizens saw as 'an enemy who became a friend.' ""            In Ha'aretz , Danny Rubinstein, an expert on Palestinian affairs,contrasted Israel's outpouring of grief over the king's death tothe relative indifference of the Palestinians. There are no special signs ofmourning among the Palestinian public, he wrote, quoting a man in an EastJerusalem coffee house: ""Netanyahu is sadder and more concerned than we are.""Rubinstein said that the merchants of East Jerusalem were principally concernedabout the weekend's fall in the value of the Jordanian currency, the dinar, inwhich they kept most of their savings. And he noted that in Gaza and Nablus inrecent days there has been more pictures of Saddam Hussein on display than ofthe Hashemite king.            Other comment Monday inthe Israeli press focused on the aftermath of Hussein's death and Jordan'sprospects under King Abdullah. In Yediot Aharanot , Danny Rothchild, aformer intelligence officer of the Israeli Defence Forces, predicted that thetransfer of power in Jordan will take place ""without many shocks"" but thatthere will be hard times ahead for the Jordanian people. The Jordanian economyis in a deep recession, he wrote, and will get even worse unless the Jordaniangovernment urgently tackles unemployment, the stability of the currency, andthe trade balance. Another urgent problem is the country's water shortage, headded, ""If they do not solve it immediately, a drought in the summer will leadto intolerable dependence on Jordan's neighbors.""            Rothchild wrote that the ""external threat"" to Jordan doesnot seem especially grave at the moment, though there is the risk of Iraqisubversion with so many Iraqi exiles on Jordanian soil and at its borders. Buthe said the new king will have to focus a lot of attention on preserving calmwithin the royal family, which until now has been kept in order by Hussein,with his absolute authority and ""almost obsessive"" concern for the maintenanceof family unity. On Jordan's relationship with Israel and the continuation ofthe peace process, Rothchild urged that King Abdullah be allowed to deal withother problems first. ""All those with the welfare of the king and his kingdom,as well as ours, at heart would do well not to force him to confront thesecomplex and sensitive issues at this time,"" he wrote.            Writing forHa'aretz from Amman, Zvi Bar'el noted that aJordanian publicist had dubbed King Abdullah ""a king for the Internet age"" andsuggested this might make his relations difficult with veteran Arab leaderssuch as Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Hafez Assad of Syria, and King Fahd of SaudiArabia. ""Won't he have to prove that his Arab credentials are no less solidthan theirs?"" he asked. But in the new king's favor, Bar'el pointed out that hewas the first Jordanian monarch not to be weighed down by the trauma of losingnational territory, the first Arab leader not to have taken part in fatefuldecisions about Iraq, and someone for whom peace with Israel was a givenreality that did not need to be justified.

The more these authorized villains are shot at inStallone-Schwartzenegger-Willis-Gibson movies, the more one wants to be a drugdealer or terrorist when he grows up.

It is harder to rebuff a national enemies list whenbombs are falling, particularly when those enemies are implicated in appallingdeeds. It might, however, be possible to resist the grossest forms of jingoism.Consider how badly certain World War II songs have aged--""I'm Going To SlapThat Dirty Little Jap.""

4,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.            The algorithm INSIDE is as follows:                        Input: A CM subgraph and            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .                        Output: Scoring matrix decks                            r              ..                           z              .

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.            The algorithm INSIDE is as follows:                        Input: A CM subgraph and            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .                        Output: Scoring matrix decks                            r              ..                           z              .

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
0,ARRCYSZKA3U4.TUUBSJ6C26CN1@mimefactory.state.tld,Input: A CM subgraph and subsequence x g,2018-01-02T00:00:00,Normal,"                    Background        There are a growing number of RNA gene families and RNA        motifs [ 1 2 ] . Many (though not all) RNAs conserve a        base-paired RNA secondary structure. Computational analyses        of RNA sequence families are more powerful if they take        into account both primary sequence and secondary structure        consensus [ 3 4 ] .        Some excellent approaches have been developed for        database searching with RNA secondary structure consensus        patterns. Exact- and approximate-match pattern searches        (analogous to PROSITE patterns for proteins) have been        extended to allow patterns to specify long-range base        pairing constraints [ 5 6 ] . In several cases, specialized        programs have been developed to recognize specific RNA        structures [ 4 ] - for example, programs exist for        detecting transfer RNA genes [ 7 8 9 ] , group I catalytic        introns [ 10 ] , and small nucleolar RNAs [ 11 12 ] . All        of these approaches, though powerful, lack generality, and        they require expert knowledge about each particular RNA        family of interest.        In primary sequence analysis, the most useful analysis        techniques are general primary sequence alignment        algorithms with probabilistically based scoring systems -        for example, the BLAST [ 13 ] , FASTA [ 14 ] , or CLUSTALW        [ 15 ] algorithms, and the PAM [ 16 ] or BLOSUM [ 17 ]        score matrices. Unlike specialized programs, a general        alignment algorithm can be applied to find homologs of any        query sequence(s). Unlike pattern searches, which give        yes/no answers for whether a candidate sequence is a match,        a scoring system gives a meaningful score that allows        ranking candidate hits by their statistical significance.        It is of interest to develop general alignment algorithms        for RNA secondary structures.        The problem I consider here is as follows. I am given a        multiple alignment of an RNA sequence family for which I        know the consensus secondary structure. I want to search a        sequence database for homologs that significantly match the        sequence         and structure of my query. The        sequence analysis analogue is the use of profile hidden        Markov models (profile HMMs) to model multiple alignments        of conserved protein domains, and to discover new        homologues in sequence databases [ 18 19 ] . For instance,        if we had an RNA structure equivalent of the HMMER profile        HMM program suite http://hmmer.wustl.edu/it would be        possible to develop and efficiently maintain databases of        conserved RNA structures and multiple alignments, analogous        to the Pfam or SMART databases of conserved protein domains        [ 20 21 ] .        Stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) algorithms        provide a general approach to RNA structure alignment [ 22        23 24 ] . SCFGs allow the strong pairwise residue        correlations in non-pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure        to be taken into account in RNA alignments. SCFGs can be        aligned to sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm        that guarantees finding a mathematically optimal solution        in polynomial time. SCFG alignment algorithms can be        thought of as an extension of sequence alignment algorithms        (particularly those with fully probabilistic, hidden Markov        model formulations) into an additional dimension necessary        to deal with 2D RNA secondary structure.        While SCFGs provide a natural mathematical framework for        RNA secondary structure alignment problems, SCFG algorithms        have high computational complexity that has impeded their        practical application. Optimal SCFG-based structural        alignment of an RNA structure to a sequence costs         O (         N 3) memory and         O (         N 4) time for a sequence of length         N, compared to         O (         N 2) memory and time for sequence        alignment algorithms. (Corpet and Michot described a        program that implements a different general dynamic        programming algorithm for RNA alignment; their algorithm        solves the same problem but even less efficiently,        requiring         O (         N 4) memory and         O (         N 5) time [ 25 ] .) SCFG-based        alignments of small structural RNAs are feasible. Using my        COVE software        http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software#cove, transfer        RNA alignments (~75 nucleotides) take about 0.2 cpu second        and 3 Mb of memory. Most genome centers now use an        COVE-based search program, tRNAscan-SE, for annotating        transfer RNA genes [ 9 ] . However, many larger RNAs of        interest are OUTSIDE the capabilities of the standard SCFG        alignment algorithm. Alignment of a small subunit (SSU)        ribosomal RNA sequence to the SSU rRNA consensus structure        would take about 23 GB of RAM and an hour of CPU time.        Applying SCFG methods to RNAs this large has required        clever heuristics, such as using a precalculation of        confidently predicted regions of primary sequence alignment        to strongly constrain which parts of the SCFG dynamic        programming matrix need to be calculated [ 26 ] . The steep        memory requirement remains a significant barrier to the        practicality of SCFG algorithms.        Notredame         et al. pointed specifically to this        problem [ 27 ] . They described RAGA, a program that uses a        genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a pairwise RNA alignment        using an objective function that includes base pairing        terms. Because GAs have an O(         N ) memory requirement, RAGA can find        reasonable solutions for large RNA alignment problems,        including ribosomal RNA alignments. A different        memory-efficient approach has also been described [ 28 29 ]        . However, both approaches are approximate and cannot        guarantee a mathematically optimal solution, in contrast to        the (mathematically) optimal but more expensive dynamic        programming approaches.        Here, I introduce a dynamic programming solution to the        problem of structural alignment of large RNAs. The central        idea is a divide and conquer strategy. For linear sequence        alignment, a divide and conquer algorithm was introduced by        Hirschberg [ 30 ] , an algorithm known in the computational        biology community as the Myers/Miller algorithm [ 31 ] .        (Ironically, at the time, dynamic programming methods for        optimal sequence alignment were well known, but were        considered impractical on 1970's era computers because of        the ""extreme""         O (         N 2) memory requirement.)        Myers/Miller reduces the memory complexity of a dynamic        programming sequence alignment algorithm from         O (         N 2) to         O (         N ), at the cost of a roughly        two-fold increase in CPU time. Here I show that a divide        and conquer strategy can also be applied to the RNA        structural alignment problem, greatly reducing the memory        requirement of SCFG alignments and making optimal        structural alignment of large RNAs possible.        I will strictly be dealing with the problem of aligning        a target sequence of unknown secondary structure to a query        of known RNA structure. By ""secondary structure"" I mean        nested (nonpseudoknotted) pairwise RNA secondary structure        interactions, primarily Watson-Crick base pairs but also        permitting noncanonical base pairs. This RNA structural        alignment problem is different from the problem of aligning        two known RNA secondary structures together [ 32 ] , and        from the problem of aligning two RNA sequences of unknown        structure together under a secondary structure-aware        scoring system [ 33 34 35 36 37 ] .                    Algorithm                  Prelude: the simpler case of sequence          alignment          The essential concepts of a divide and conquer          alignment algorithm are most easily understood for the          case of linear sequence alignment [ 30 31 ] .          Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for sequence          alignment fill in an           N            M DP matrix of scores           F(i,j) for two sequences of lengths                    N and           M (           N <           M ) [ 38 39 ] . Each score           F(i,j) is the score of the optimal          alignment of prefix           x           1 ..           x                       i            of one sequence to prefix           y           1 ..           y                       j            of the other. These scores are calculated          iteratively, e.g. for global (Needleman/Wunsch)          alignment:                    At the end,           F(N, M) contains the score of the          optimal alignment. The alignment itself is recovered by          tracing the individual optimal steps backwards through          the matrix, starting from cell (           N,M ). The algorithm is           O(NM) in both time and memory.          If we are only interested in the score, not the          alignment itself, the whole           F matrix does not have to be kept          in memory. The iterative calculation only depends on the          current and previous row of the matrix. Keeping two rows          in memory suffices (in fact, a compulsively efficient          implementation can get away with           N + 1 cells). A score-only          calculation can be done in           O (           N ) space.          The fill stage of DP alignment algorithms may be run          either forwards and backwards. We can just as easily          calculate the optimal score           B(i, j) of the best alignment of          the           suffix i + 1..           N of sequence 1 to the suffix           j + 1..           M of sequence 2, until one obtains          B(0,0), the overall optimal score - the same number as           F(N,M).           The sum of           F(i,j) and           B(i,j) at any cell in the optimal          path through the DP matrix is also the optimal overall          alignment score. More generally,           F(i,j) + B(i,j) at any cell (           i,j ) is the score of the best          alignment that uses that cell. Therefore, since we know          the optimal alignment must pass through any given row           i somewhere, we can pick some row           i in the middle of sequence           x, run the forward calculation to           i to obtain row           F(i), run the backwards calculation          back to           i to get row           B(i), and then find argmax                       j                      F (           i ,           j )+           B (           i ,           j ). Now I know the optimal          alignment passes through cell (           i,j ). (For clarity, I am leaving          out details of how indels and local alignments are          handled.)          This divides the alignment into two smaller alignment          problems, and these smaller problems can themselves be          subdivided by the same trick. Thus, the complete optimal          alignment can be found by a recursive series of split          point calculations. Although this seems laborious - each          calculation is giving us only a single point in the          alignment - if we choose our split row           i to be in the middle, the size of          the two smaller DP problems is decreased by about 4-fold          at each split. A complete alignment thus costs only about          times as much CPU time as doing the alignment in a single          DP matrix calculation, but the algorithm is           O (           N ) in memory.          A standard dynamic programming alignment algorithm for          SCFGs is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, which          finds an optimal parse tree (e.g. alignment) for a model          and a sequence [ 24 40 41 42 ] . (CYK is usually          described in the literature as a dynamic programming          recognition algorithm for nonstochastic CFGs in Chomsky          normal form, rather than as a dynamic programming parsing          algorithm for SCFGs in any form. The use of the name          ""CYK"" here is therefore a little imprecise [ 24 ] .) CYK          can be run in a memory-saving ""score only"" mode. The DP          matrix for CYK can also be filled in two opposite          directions - either ""inside"" or ""outside"", analogous to          forward and backward DP matrix fills for linear sequence          alignment. I will refer to these algorithms as CYK/inside          and CYK/outside (or just inside and outside), but readers          familiar with SCFG algorithms should not confuse them          with the SCFG Inside and Outside algorithms [ 43 44 ]          which sum over all possible parse trees rather than          finding one optimal parse tree. I am always talking about          the CYK algorithm in this paper, and by ""inside"" and          ""outside"" I am only referring generically to the          direction of the CYK DP calculation.          The CYK/inside and CYK/outside algorithms are not as          nicely symmetrical as the forward and backward DP fills          are in sequence alignment algorithms. The splitting          procedure that one obtains does not generate identical          types of subproblems, so the divide and conquer procedure          for SCFG-based RNA alignment is not as obvious.                          Definition and construction of a covariance          model                      Definition of a stochastic context free            grammar            A stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) consists of            the following:                         M different nonterminals (here            called             states ). I will use capital            letters to refer to specific nonterminals;             V and             Y will be used to refer            generically to unspecified nonterminals.                         K different terminal symbols            (e.g. the observable alphabet, a,c,g,u for RNA). I will            use small letters             a, b to refer generically to            terminal symbols.             a number of             production rules of the form:             V  , where  can be any string            of nonterminal and/or terminal symbols, including (as a            special case) the empty string .             Each production rule is associated with a            probability, such that the sum of the production            probabilities for any given nonterminal             V is equal to 1.                                SCFG productions allowed in covariance            models            A covariance model is a specific repetitive ""profile            SCFG"" architecture consisting of groups of model states            that are associated with base pairs and single-stranded            positions in an RNA secondary structure consensus. A            covariance model has seven types of states and            production rules (Table 1).            Each overall production probability is the            independent product of an emission probability             e                           v              and a transition probability             t                           v              , both of which are position-dependent parameters            that depend on the state             v (analogous to hidden Markov            models). For example, a particular pair (P) state             v produces two correlated letters                        a and             b (e.g. one of 16 possible base            pairs) with probability             e                           v              (             a ,             b ) and transits to one of            several possible new states             Y of various types with            probability             t                           v              (             Y ). A bifurcation (B) state            splits into two new start (             S ) states with probability 1.            The E state is a special case  production that            terminates a derivation.            A CM consists of many states of these seven basic            types, each with its own emission and transition            probability distributions, and its own set of states            that it can transition to. Consensus base pairs will be            modeled by P states, consensus single stranded residues            by L and R states, insertions relative to the consensus            by more L and R states, deletions relative to consensus            by D states, and the branching topology of the RNA            secondary structure by B, S, and E states. The            procedure for starting from an input multiple alignment            and determining how many states, what types of states,            and how they are interconnected by transition            probabilities is described next.                                From consensus structural alignment to guide            tree            Figure 1shows an example input file: a multiple            sequence alignment of homologous RNAs, with a line            describing the consensus RNA secondary structure. The            first step of building a CM is to produce a binary             guide tree of nodes representing            the consensus secondary structure. The guide tree is a            parse tree for the consensus structure, with nodes as            nonterminals and alignment columns as terminals.            The guide tree has eight types of nodes (Table            2).            These consensus node types correspond closely with a            CM's final state types. Each node will eventually            contain one or more states. The guide tree deals with            the consensus structure. For individual sequences, we            will need to deal with insertions and deletions with            respect to this consensus. The guide tree is the            skeleton on which we will organize the CM. For example,            a MATP node will contain a P-type state to model a            consensus base pair; but it will also contain several            other states to model infrequent insertions and            deletions at or adjacent to this pair.            The input alignment is first used to construct a            consensus secondary structure (Figure 2) that defines            which aligned columns will be ignored as non-consensus            (and later modeled as insertions relative to the            consensus), and which consensus alignment columns are            base-paired to each other. Here I assume that both the            structural annotation and the labeling of insert versus            consensus columns is given in the input file, as shown            in the line marked ""[structure]"" in the alignment in            Figure 1. Alternatively, automatic methods might be            employed. A consensus structure could be predicted from            comparative analysis of the alignment [ 22 45 46 ] .            The consensus columns could be chosen as those columns            with less than a certain fraction of gap symbols, or by            a maximum likelihood criterion, as is done for profile            HMM construction [ 18 24 ] .            Given the consensus structure, consensus base pairs            are assigned to MATP nodes and consensus unpaired            columns are assigned to MATL or MATR nodes. One ROOT            node is used at the head of the tree. Multifurcation            loops and/or multiple stems are dealt with by assigning            one or more BIF nodes that branch to subtrees starting            with BEGL or BEGR head nodes. (ROOT, BEGL, and BEGR            start nodes are labeled differently because they will            be expanded to different groups of states; this has to            do with avoiding ambiguous parse trees for individual            sequences, as described below.) Alignment columns that            are considered to be insertions relative to the            consensus structure are ignored at this stage.            In general there will be more than one possible            guide tree for any given consensus structure. Almost            all of this ambiguity is eliminated by three            conventions: (1) MATL nodes are always used instead of            MATR nodes where possible, for instance in hairpin            loops; (2) in describing interior loops, MATL nodes are            used before MATR nodes; and (3) BIF nodes are only            invoked where necessary to explain branching secondary            structure stems (as opposed to unnecessarily            bifurcating in single stranded sequence). One source of            ambiguity remains. In invoking a bifurcation to explain            alignment columns             i..j by two substructures on            columns             i..k and             k + 1..             j, there will be more than one            possible choice of             k if             i..j is a multifurcation loop            containing three or more stems. The choice of             k impacts the performance of the            divide and conquer algorithm; for optimal time            performance, we will want bifurcations to split into            roughly equal sized alignment problems, so I choose the                        k that makes             i..k and             k + 1..             j as close to the same length as            possible.            The result of this procedure is the guide tree. The            nodes of the guide tree are numbered in preorder            traversal (e.g. a recursion of ""number the current            node, visit its left child, visit its right child"":            thus parent nodes always have lower indices than their            children). The guide tree corresponding to the input            multiple alignment in Figure 1is shown in Figure 2.                                From guide tree to covariance model            A CM must deal with insertions and deletions in            individual sequences relative to the consensus            structure. For example, for a consensus base pair,            either partner may be deleted leaving a single unpaired            residue, or the pair may be entirely deleted;            additionally, there may be inserted nonconsensus            residues between this pair and the next pair in the            stem. Accordingly, each node in the master tree is            expanded into one or more             states in the CM as follows            (Table 3)            Here we distinguish between consensus (""M"", for            ""match"") states and insert (""I"") states. ML and IL, for            example, are both L type states with L type            productions, but they will have slightly different            properties, as described below.            The states are grouped into a             split set of 1-4 states (shown in            brackets above) and an             insert set of 0-2 insert states.            The split set includes the main consensus state, which            by convention is first. One and only one of the states            in the split set must be visited in every parse tree            (and this fact will be exploited by the divide and            conquer algorithm). The insert state(s) are not            obligately visited, and they have self-transitions, so            they will be visited zero or more times in any given            parse tree.            State transitions are then assigned as follows. For            bifurcation nodes, the B state makes obligate            transitions to the S states of the child BEGL and BEGR            nodes. For other nodes, each state in a split set has a            possible transition to every insert state in the             same node, and to every state in            the split set of the             next node. An IL state makes a            transition to itself, to the IR state in the same node            (if present), and to every state in the split set of            the next node. An IR state makes a transition to itself            and to every state in the split set of the next            node.            This arrangement of transitions guarantees that            (given the guide tree) there is unambiguously one and            only one parse tree for any given individual structure.            This is important. The algorithm will find a maximum            likelihood parse tree for a given sequence, and we wish            to interpret this result as a maximum likelihood            structure, so there must be a one to one relationship            between parse trees and secondary structures [ 47 ]            .            The final CM is an array of             M states, connected as a directed            graph by transitions             t                           v              (             y ) (or probability 1 transitions                        v  (             y,z ) for bifurcations) with the            states numbered such that (             y,z )              v. There are no cycles in the            directed graph other than cycles of length one (e.g.            the self-transitions of the insert states). We can            think of the CM as an array of states in which all            transition dependencies run in one direction; we can do            an iterative dynamic programming calculation through            the model states starting with the last numbered end            state             M and ending in the root state 1.            An example CM, corresponding to the input alignment of            Figure 1, is shown in Figure 3.            As a convenient side effect of the construction            procedure, it is guaranteed that the transitions from            any state are to a             contiguous set of child states,            so the transitions for state             v may be kept as an offset and a            count. For example, in Figure 3, state 12 (an MP)            connects to states 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. We can            store this as an offset of 4 to the first connected            state, and a total count of 6 connected states. We know            that the offset is the distance to the next non-split            state in the current node; we also know that the count            is equal to the number of insert states in the current            node, plus the number of split set states in the next            node. These properties make establishing the            connectivity of the CM trivial. Similarly, all the            parents of any given state are also contiguously            numbered, and can be determined analogously. We are            also guaranteed that the states in a split set are            numbered contiguously. This contiguity is exploited by            the divide and conquer implementation.                                Parameterization            Using the guide tree and the final CM, each            individual sequence in the input multiple alignment can            be converted unambiguously to a CM parse tree, as shown            in Figure 4. Counts for observed state transitions and            singlet/pair emissions are then collected from these            parse trees. The observed counts are converted to            transition and emission probabilities by standard            procedures. I calculate maximum a posteriori            parameters, using Dirichlet priors.                                Comparison to profile HMMs            The relationship between an SCFG and a covariance            model is analogous to the relationship of hidden Markov            models (HMMs) and profile HMMs for modeling multiple            sequence alignments [ 18 19 24 ] . A comparison may be            instructive to readers familiar with profile HMMs. A            profile HMM is a repetitive HMM architecture that            associates each consensus column of a multiple            alignment with a single type of model node - a MATL            node, in the above notation. Each node contains a            ""match"", ""delete"", and ""insert"" HMM state - ML, IL, and            D states, in the above notation. The profile HMM also            has special begin and end states. Profile HMMs could            therefore be thought of as a special case of CMs. An            unstructured RNA multiple alignment would be modeled by            a guide tree of all MATL nodes, and converted to an            unbifurcated CM that would essentially be identical to            a profile HMM. (The only difference is trivial; the CM            root node includes a IR state, whereas the start node            of a profile HMM does not.) All the other node types            (especially MATP, MATR, and BIF) and state types (e.g.            MP, MR, IR, and B) are SCFG augmentations necessary to            extend profile HMMs to deal with RNA secondary            structure.            The SCFG inside and outside algorithms are analogous            to the Forward and Backward algorithms for HMMs [ 24 48            ] . The CYK/inside parsing algorithm is analogous to            the Viterbi HMM alignment algorithm run in the forward            direction. CYK/outside is analogous to a Viterbi DP            algorithm run in the backwards direction.                                    Divide and conquer algorithm                      Notation            I use             r, v, w, y, and             z as indices of states in the            model, where             r  (             v ,             w ,             y )              z. These indices will range from            1..             M , for a CM             G that contains             M states. refers to a subgraph of            the model, rooted at state             r and ending at state             z, for a contiguous set of states                        r..z. G             r , without a subscript, refers            to a subgraph of the model rooted at state             r and ending at the highest            numbered E state descendant from state             r. The complete model is , or             G 1, or just             G.                         S                           v              refers to the             type of state             v ; it will be one of seven types            {D,P,L,R,S,E,B}.             C                           v              is a list of children for state             v (e.g. the states that             v can transit to); it will            contain up to six contiguous indices             y with             v              y              M .             P                           v              is a list of parents for state             v (states that could have            transited to state             v ); it will contain up to six            contiguous indices             y with 1              y              v. (             P                           v              parent lists should not be confused with P state            types.)            I use             g, h, i, j, k, p, and             q as indices referring to            positions in a sequence             x, where             g              h              p              q and             i              j for all subsequences of nonzero            length. These indices range from 1..             L, for a sequence of length             L . Some algorithms will also use                        d to refer to a subsequence            length, where             d =             j -             i + 1 for a subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .            The algorithms will have to account for subsequences            of zero length (because of deletions). By convention,            these will be in the off-diagonal where             j =             i - 1 or             i =             j + 1. This special case (usually            an initialization condition) is the reason for the            qualification that             i              j for subsequences of             nonzero length.            The CYK/inside algorithm calculates a            three-dimensional matrix of numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ), and CYK/outside calculates            numbers                            v              (             i ,             j ). I will refer to             v (state indices) as             deck coordinates in the            three-dimensional matrices, whereas             j and             i (sequence positions) are row            and column coordinates within each deck.                            v              and                            v              refer to whole two-dimensional decks containing            scores                            v              (             i ,             j ) and                            v              (             i ,             j ) for a particular state             v. The dividing and conquering            will be done in the             v dimension, by choosing            particular decks as split points.                                The CYK/inside algorithm            The CYK/inside algorithm iteratively calculates                            v              (             i ,             j ) - the log probability of the            most likely CM parse subtree rooted at state             v that generates subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              of sequence             x. The calculation initializes at            the smallest subgraphs and subsequences (e.g. subgraphs            rooted at E states, generating subsequences of length            0), and iterates outwards to progessively longer            subsequences and larger CM subgraphs.            For example, if we're calculating                            v              (             i ,             j ) and             S                           v              = P (that is,             v is a pair state),             v will generate the pair             x                           i              ,             x                           j              and transit to a new state             y (one of its possible            transitions             C                           v              ) which then will have to account for the smaller            subsequence             x                         i +1 ..             x                         j -1 . The log probability            for a particular choice of next state             y is the sum of three terms: an            emission term log             e                           v              (             x                           i              ,             x                           j              ), a transition term log             t                           v              (             y ), and an already calculated            solution for the smaller optimal parse tree rooted at             y ,                            y              (             i + 1,             j - 1). The answer for                            v              (             i ,             j ) is the maximum over all            possible choices of child states             y that             v can transit to.

M ) to the whole sequence (             x             1 ..             x                           L              ). When INSIDE returns,              1 (1,             L ) would contain the log            probability of the best parse of the complete sequence            with the complete model.            We do not have to keep the entire             three-dimensional matrix in memory to calculate these            scores. As we reach higher decks                            v              in the three dimensional dynamic programming            matrix, our calculations no longer depend on certain            lower decks. A lower deck             y can be deallocated whenever all            the parent decks             P                           y              that depend on it have been calculated. (The            implementation goes even further and recycles decks            when possible, saving some initialization steps and            many memory allocation calls; for example, since values            in all E decks are identical, only one E deck needs to            be calculated and that precalculated deck can be reused            whenever             S                           v              =             E .)            This deallocation rule has an important property            that the divide and conquer algorithm takes advantage            of when solving smaller subproblems for CM subgraphs            rooted at some state             w. When the root state             w is an S state, the  matrix            returned by INSIDE contains only one active deck                            w              . (No lower state >             w can be reached from any state            <             w without going through             w, so all lower decks are            deallocated once deck             w is completed.) When the root            state             w is the first state in a split            set             w..y (see below for more            explanation), all (and only) the decks                            w              ..                           y              are active when INSIDE returns.            In some cases we want to recover the optimal parse            tree itself, not just its score. The INSIDE routine is            a modified version of INSIDE. It keeps an additional            ""shadow matrix""                            v              (             i,j ). A                            v              (             i,j ) traceback pointer either            records the index             y that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) (for state types D,S,P,L,R)            or records the split point             k that maximized                            v              (             i,j ) for a bifurcation (B)            state. The  shadow matrix does not use the            deallocation rules - INSIDE can only be called for            problems small enough that they can be solved within            our available memory space. Thus the INSIDE routine            works by calling INSIDE in a mode that also keeps a            shadow matrix , and then calls a recursive traceback            starting with             v, i, j :                        Input: A shadow matrix  for CM            subgraph             G             v rooted at state             v, and subsequence             x                           i              ..             x                           j              .

The calculation initializes with the entire            sequence excluded (e.g.              1 (1,             L ) = 0), and iterates inward to            progressively shorter and shorter excluded subsequences            and smaller CM subgraphs.            A complete implementation of the CYK/outside            algorithm requires first calculating the CYK/inside            matrix  because it is needed to calculate                            v              when the parent of             v is a bifurcation [ 24 43 44 ] .            However, the divide and conquer algorithm described            here only calls OUTSIDE on             unbifurcated, linear CM            subgraphs (only the final state             z may be a B state; there are no            internal bifurcations that lead to branches in the            model). Thus the parent of a state             v is never a bifurcation, and the            implementation can therefore be streamlined as            follows:                        Input: An unbifurcated CM subgraph            and subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              .

A deck                            v              can be deallocated when all child decks             C                           v              that depend on the values in                            v              have been calculated. This means that if the last            deck             z is a bifurcation or end state,                                       z              will be the only active allocated deck when            OUTSIDE returns. If             z is the last state in a split            set             w..z, all (and only) the split            set decks                            w              ..                           z              will be active when OUTSIDE returns.                                Using CYK/inside and CYK/outside to divide and            conquer            Now, for any chosen state             v, argmax                         i ,             j  [                           v              (             i, j ) +                            v              (             ,i,j )] tells us which cell             v, i, j the optimal parse tree            passes through, conditional on using state             v in the parse. We know that any            parse tree must include all the bifurcation and start            states of the CM, so we know that the optimal alignment                        must use any chosen bifurcation            state             v and its child start states             w and             y. Thus, we are guaranteed that            (when             S                           v              = B and             C                           v              =             w, y ):                        is the optimal overall alignment score, and we also            know that                        gives us a triplet that identifies three cells that            must be in the optimal alignment - (             v, i, j ), (             w, i, k ), and (             y, k + 1,             j ). This splits the remaining            problem into three smaller subproblems - an alignment            of the sequence             x                           i              ..             x                           k              to a CM subgraph             w..y - 1, an alignment of the            sequence             x                         k +1 ..             x                           j              to a CM subgraph             y..M , and an alignment of the            two-piece sequence             x             1 ..             z                         i -1 //             x                         j +1 ..             x                           L              to a CM subgraph 1..             v .            The subproblems are then themselves split, and this            splitting can continue recursively until all the            bifurcation triplets on the optimal parse tree have            been determined.            At this point the remaining alignment subproblems            might be small enough to be solved by straightforward            application of the standard CYK/inside algorithm (e.g.            INSIDE ). However, this is not guaranteed to be the            case. A more general division strategy is needed that            does not depend on splitting at bifurcations.            For the more general strategy we take advantage of            the fact that we know that the optimal parse tree must            also include one and only one state from the split set            of each node (e.g. the non-insert states in the node).            Let             w..y be the indices of a split            set of states in the middle of the current model            subgraph. (             w..y can be at most 4 states.) We            know that                        gives us a new cell (             v, i, j ) in the optimal parse            tree, and splits the problem into two smaller problems.            This strategy can be applied recursively all the way            down to single nodes, if necessary. We can therefore            guarantee that we will never need to carry out a full            CYK/inside alignment algorithm on any subproblem. The            most memory-intensive alignment problem that needs to            be solved is the very first split. The properties of            the first split determine the memory complexity of the            algorithm.            The bifurcation-dependent strategy is a special case            of this more general splitting strategy, where the B            state is the only member of its split set, and where we            also take advantage of the fact that                            v              (             i ,             j ) = max                           k                                         w              (             i, k ) +                            y              (             k + 1,             j ). By carrying out the max                           k              operation during the split, rather than before, we            can split the current problem into three optimal pieces            instead of just two.            If we look at the consequences of these splitting            strategies, we see we will have to deal with three            types of problems (Figure 5):             A             generic problem means finding the            optimal alignment of a CM subgraph to a contiguous            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . The subgraph corresponds to a complete subtree            of the CM's guide tree - e.g. state             r is a start (S), and state             z is an end (E). may contain            bifurcations. The problem is solved in one of two ways.            If contains no bifurcations, it is solved as a wedge            problem (see below). Else, the problem is subdivided by            the bifurcation-dependent strategy: an optimal triple            (i,             k, j ) is found for a bifurcation            state             v and its children             w, y, splitting the problem into            a V problem and two generic problems.             A             wedge problem means finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            contiguous subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . State             z does not have to be a start            state (S); it may be a state in a split set (MP, ML,            MR, or D). State             z is an end (E). A wedge problem            is solved by the split set-dependent strategy: an            optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into a V problem and a smaller wedge            problem.             A             V problem consists of finding the            optimal alignment of an             unbifurcated CM subgraph to a            noncontiguous, two-piece sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              , exclusive of the residues             x                           h              and             x                           p              (open circles in Figure 5). State             r can be a start state or any            state in a split set; the same is true for             z. A V problem is solved by a            split set-dependent strategy: an optimal (             v, i, j ) is found, splitting the            problem into two V problems.            The three recursive splitting algorithms to solve            these problems are as follows:                                The generic_splitter routine                        Input: A generic problem, for CM            subgraph and subsequence             x                         g ..             q  .

The vinside and voutside routines            The VINSIDE and VOUTSIDE routines are just INSIDE            and OUTSIDE, modified to deal with a two-piece            subsequence             x                           g              ..             x                           h              //             x                           p              ..             x                           g              instead of a contiguous sequence             x                           g              ..             x                           q              . These modifications are fairly obvious. The            range of             i, j is restricted so that             i              h and             j              p. Also, VINSIDE (w, z; g, h; p,            q) initializes                            z              (             h ,             p ) = 0: that is, we know that            sequence             x                           h              ..             x                           p              has already been accounted for by a CM parse tree            rooted at             z.                                 Implementation            In the description of the algorithms above, some            technical detail has been omitted - in particular, a            detailed description of efficient initialization steps,            and details of how the the dynamic programming matrices            are laid out in memory. These details are not necessary            for a high level understanding of the divide and            conquer algorithm. However, they may be necessary for            reproducing a working implementation.

This code has been tested on            GNU/Linux platforms.            In this codebase, the CM data structure is defined            in structs.h.

Results and discussion                  Memory complexity analysis          The memory complexity of normal CYK/inside is           O (           N 2           M ), for a model of           M states and a query sequence of           N residues, since the full 3D          dynamic programming matrix is indexed           N            N            M (and since           N            M , we can alternatively state the          upper bound as           O (           N 3)). The memory complexity of the          divide and conquer algorithm is           O (           N 2log           M ). The analysis that leads to          this conclusion is as follows.          For a model with no bifurcations, the divide and          conquer algorithm will never require more than 10 decks          in memory at once. In the case of two adjacent MATP          nodes, we will need six decks to store the scores for the          current node we're calculating, and four decks for the          split set of the adjacent node that we're connecting to          (and dependent upon) (Figure 3).          Bifurcations will require some number of additional          decks for start states (BEGL_S and BEGR_S) to be kept. In          INSIDE, whenever we reach a deck for a start state, we          will keep that deck in memory until we reach the parent          bifurcation state. Half the time, that will mean waiting          until another complete subgraph of the model is          calculated (e.g. the subgraph rooted at the other start          child of that bifurcation); that is, to calculate deck                        v            for a bifurcation           v, we need both decks                        w            and                        y            for its child start states           w and           y, so we have to hold on to                        y            until we reach                        w            . In turn, the subgraph rooted at           w might contain bifurcations, so          our calculation of                        w            might require additional decks to be kept. Each          start deck we reach in the INSIDE iteration means holding          one extra deck in memory, and each bifurcation we reach          means deallocating the two start decks it depends on;          therefore we can iteratively calculate the maximum number          of extra decks we will require:                    x                       M             -1                    for v            M -1           to 1                              return max                       v                      x                       v                      This number depends on the topology and order of          evaluation of the states in the CM. Think of the          bifurcating structure of the CM as a binary tree numbered          in preorder traversal (e.g. left children are visited          first, and have lower indices than right children). If          this is a complete balanced tree with           B bifurcations, we will need log           2           B extra decks. If it is a maximally          unbalanced tree in which bifurcations only occur in left          children, we will need           B extra decks (all the right          children). If it is a maximally unbalanced tree in which          bifurcations only occur in right children, we will only          ever need 1 extra deck. A left-unbalanced binary tree can          be converted to a right-unbalanced binary tree just by          swapping branches. For a CM, we can't swap branches          without affecting the order of the sequence that's          generated. We can, however, get the same effect by          renumbering the CM states in a modified preorder          traversal. Instead of always visiting the left subtree          first, we visit the best subtree first, where ""best""          means the choice that will optimize memory usage. This          reordering is readily calculated in           O (           M ) time (not shown; see cm.          c:CMRebalance() in the implementation). This way, we can          never do worse than the balanced case, and we will often          do better. We never need more than log           2           B extra decks. Since           B <           M, we can guarantee a           O (           N 2log           M ) bound on memory complexity.                          Time complexity analysis          The time complexity of the standard algorithm is           O (           MN 2+           BN 3), for a model of           M states (           B of which are bifurcations)          aligned to a sequence of           N residues. Since           B <           M, and           M            N, we can also state the upper          bound as           O (           MN 3) or           O (           N 4).          The time complexity of the divide and conquer          algorithm depends on how close each split is to dividing          a problem into equal sized subproblems. In the most ideal          case, each call to GENERIC_SPLITTER could split into          three subproblems that each contained 1/3 of the states          and residues: splitting those three subproblems would          only cost:          3             MN 3          in time, e.g. only about 1/27 the time it took to          split the first problem. Thus in an ideal case the time          requirement is almost completely dominated by the first          split, and the extra time required to do the complete          divide and conquer algorithm could be negligible. In          pathological cases, optimal splits might lead to a series          of very unequally sized problems. We never need to do          more splits than there are states in the model, so we          cannot do worse than           O (           M 2           N 3) in time.          An example of a pathological case is an RNA structure          composed of a series of multifurcation loops such that          each bifurcation leads to a small stem on one side, and          the rest of the structure on the other. In such a case,          every call to GENERIC_SPLITTER will split into a small          subproblem containing a small stem (e.g. only removing a          constant number of states and residues per split) and a          large subproblem containing all the remaining states and          sequence. This case can be avoided. It only arises          because of the decision to implement a simplified          CYK/Outside algorithm and always split at the highest          bifurcations. Better time performance could be guaranteed          if a complete CYK/Outside algorithm were implemented (at          the cost of complexity in the description and          implementation of the algorithm). This would allow us to          choose a split point in a generic problem at any state in          the CM (for instance, in the middle) regardless of its          bifurcating structure.          In practice, empirical results on a variety of real          RNAs (see below) indicate that the extra time required to          do the divide and conquer is a small constant factor. A          more complex implementation does not seem to be          necessary.                          Empirical results          Six structural RNA families were chosen for empirical          evaluations of the algorithm, using available RNA          database resources - tRNA [ 49 ] , 5S ribosomal RNA [ 50          ] , signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA [ 51 ] , RNase          P [ 52 ] , small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA [ 53 ] , and          large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA [ 54 ] . For each          family, a secondary structure annotated multiple          alignment of four or five example sequences was          extracted, and used to construct a CM.          The top of Table 4shows some statistics about these          alignments and CMs. The number of consensus columns in          the alignments ranges from 72 (tRNA) to 2898 (LSU rRNA);          about 55-60% are involved in consensus base pairs. The          number of CM states is consistently about 3-fold more          than the consensus alignment length, ranging from 230          states (tRNA) to 9023 (LSU). About 1/150 of the states in          each model are bifurcations. After optimal reordering of          the model states, the number of extra decks required by          the alignment algorithm is small, ranging up to 3 for SSU          and 5 for LSU rRNA. Therefore the minimum constant of 10          decks required in iterations across unbifurcated model          segments dominates the memory requirement. The memory          required for extra decks does not have much impact even          for the largest structural RNAs. (Even without optimal          reordering, the number of extra decks required for SSU          and LSU are only 7 and 9, respectively. State reordering          was only needed to assure a           O (           N 2log           M ) memory complexity bound.)          To determine the memory and CPU time requirements for          a structural alignment, one example sequence from each          family was aligned to the CM. CPU time was measured and          memory requirements were calculated for three algorithms:          (1) the full CYK/inside algorithm, but in memory-saving          score-only mode (e.g. INSIDE(1,M; 1,L); (2) the full          CYK/inside algorithm, with shadow matrix and traceback to          recover the optimal alignment (e.g. INSIDE (1,M; 1,L));          and (3) the divide and conquer algorithm to recover an          optimal alignment (e.g. GENERIC_SPLITTER (1,M; 1,L)). The          most important comparison is between the full CYK/inside          algorithm and the divide and conquer algorithm. The          score-only CYK/inside algorithm was included, because a          complete CYK alignment couldn't be done on SSU and LSU          rRNA (because of the steep memory requirement). In all          cases where comparison could be done, the scores and          alignments produced by these algorithms were verified to          be identical.          The results of these tests are shown in the bottom          half of Table 1. The memory required by divide and          conquer alignment ranges up to 271 MB for LSU rRNA,          compared to a prohibitive 151 GB for the standard CYK          algorithm. The extra CPU time required by the divide and          conquer is small; usually about 20% more, with a maximum          of about two-fold more for SRP-RNA.          The same results are plotted in Figure 6. Memory          requirements scale as expected:           N 3for standard CYK alignment, and          better than           N 2log           N for the divide and conquer          algorithm. Empirical CPU time requirements scale          similarly for the two algorithms (           N 3.24-           N 3.29). The observed performance          is better than the theoretical worst case of           O (           N 4). The proportion of extra time          required by divide and conquer is roughly constant over a          wide range of RNAs. The difference shown in Figure 6is          exaggerated because times are plotted for score-only CYK,          not complete CYK alignment, in order to include CPU times          for SSU and LSU rRNA. Because score-only CYK does not          keep a shadow traceback matrix nor perform the traceback,          it is about 20% faster than CYK alignment, as seen in the          data in Table 4.                            Conclusions        The divide and conquer algorithm described here makes it        possible to align even the largest structural RNAs to        secondary structure consensus models, without exceeding the        available memory on current computational hardware. Optimal        SSU and LSU rRNA structural alignments can be performed in        70 MB and 270 MB of memory, respectively. Previous        structural alignment algorithms had to sacrifice        mathematical optimality to achieve ribosomal RNA        alignments.        The CPU time requirement of the alignment algorithm is        still significant, and even prohibitive for certain        important applications. However, CPU time is generally an        easier issue to deal with. A variety of simple        parallelization strategies are possible. Banded dynamic        programming algorithms (e.g. calculating only relevant        parts of the matrix) of various forms can also be explored,        including not only heuristic schemes, but also optimal        algorithms based on branch and bound ideas. (Properly        implemented, banded DP algorithms would also save        additional memory.)        The algorithm takes advantage of the structure of        covariance models (profile SCFGs), splitting in the        dimension of the states of the model rather than in the        sequence dimensions. The approach does not readily apply,        therefore, to unprofiled SCFG applications in RNA secondary        structure prediction [ 34 36 55 56 ] , where the states are        fewer and more fully interconnected. For these        applications, it would seem to be necessary to divide and        conquer in the sequence dimensions to obtain any        significant improvement in memory requirements, and it is        not immediately apparent how one would do this.        The current implementation of the algorithm is not        biologically useful. It is meant only as a testbed for the        algorithm. It outputs a raw traceback structure and        alignment score, not a standardly formatted alignment file.        Most importantly, the probability parameters for models are        calculated in a very quick and simple minded fashion, and        are far from being reasonable for producing robustly        accurate structural alignments. The next step along this        line is to produce good prior distributions for estimating        better parameters, by estimating mixture Dirichlet priors        from known RNA structures [ 57 ] . At this stage it would        not be meaningful to compare the biological alignment        accuracy of this implementation to (for instance) the        excellent performance of the RAGA genetic algorithm [ 27 ]        . A biologically useful implementation with accurate        alignment performance is of course the eventual goal of        this line of work, but is not the point of the present        paper.

""Nationally there was a 14per cent increase in extreme rightwing offences last year, with the proportionconsiderably higher in the east. The German police put the number of activeneo-Nazis at 47,000, a 4.5 per cent increase on the previous year and the firstrise in four years. But that figure represents only the hard core of thoseprepared to organise and engage in violence. In the east ... much of thepopulation, young and old, is receptive to neo-Nazi ideas, sympathetic to suchviews, and often tacitly endorsing violence against the heterodox.""            Thursday,the Guardian said in an editorial: ""Worse than neo-Nazism proper and the dribble ofneo-Nazi incidents in the west is the fact that West Germans who would notconsciously embrace racist or far right ideas, seem ready to work themselves upinto a hysterical state over immigrants and foreigners, as the recent uproarover Kurds shows. What is happening in both halves of Germany in an electionyear is that the mainstream political agenda is being affected by racist andextremist ideas."" A government that sees itself as a leader in Europe ""surelyhas a duty to curb the growth of racist attitudes whether in the crude protestform they take in the east or the more subtle variants seen in the west,"" theeditorial concluded.            Meanwhile, Corriere della Sera of Milan ""deeply offended"" (source,the Times of London)Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany by publishing a front-page cartoon of him inthe uniform and helmet of a Nazi concentration-camp guard to mark his arrivalin Rome for a summit meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.Germany's FrankfurterAllgemeine later reported on the summit under the headline ""In Rome KohlCalms Anti-German Waves,"" but it also quoted at length from an article inRome's La Repubblicasuggesting that sharp differences between Germany and Italy about the singleEuropean currency--the euro--might become ""permanent."" The article complainedthat Europe's ""war of nerves"" over the euro, from which many North Europeanswould like to see Italy excluded, had split the continent into threeblocs--Franco-German, Anglo-Saxon, and South European.            PresidentClinton's problem with Monica Lewinsky made the front-page lead in severalBritish newspapers under dramatic headlines but was reported more calmly oninside pages across most of the rest of the world. It didn't, for example, makethe front page of either LeMonde or Frankfurter Allgemeine , which led instead with the MiddleEast peace talks in Washington, with much emphasis on the dispute about YasserArafat's proposed visit to the Washington Holocaust Museum.            In Jerusalem, Ha'aretz reported afurorin the Israeli Knesset when this subject came up. When Member of theKnesset Shmuel Halpert (United Torah Judaism) described the invitation toArafat as ""a desecration of the memory of the murdered in the Holocaust, thetrampling of Jewish honor and the abuse of the remaining survivors,"" SalehSaleem (Hadash) yelled back, ""If you had been alive during the Holocaust, youwould have been on the side of the Nazis."" Rechavam Ze'evi (Moledet) said thatthe authorities at two Israeli Holocaust museums who had expressed awillingness to receive Arafat were ""stoop-backed Jews who were groveling tothis scoundrel."" But Deputy Knesset Speaker Shevach Weiss (Labor), himself aHolocaust survivor, said he welcomed Arafat's visit to the Washington museum,because it would be ""a slap in the face of all Holocaust deniers.""                           Le Monde 's editorialThursday was titled ""The Pope, Fidel, and Uncle Sam,"" and it blamed the UnitedStates embargo for the fact that Cuba was still Communist. ""The embargo is oneof the mainstays of the Cuban dictatorship,"" it said. ""The White House knowsthat perfectly well, but till now Bill Clinton hasn't had the courage to faceup to the anti-Castro dogmatists in the Congress. It is a sign of the timesthat the Cuban-American opposition in Miami is beginning to evolve. If thePope, in his turn, increases the pressure against the embargo, he willparticipate once again in collapse of a Communist regime.""            In theFar East and the Pacific region, newspapers gave prominence to the failure ofthe latest International Monetary Fund rescue package to restore faith in theeconomy of Indonesia, where the national currency, the rupiah, had just fallenin value by another 30 percent. The Age of Melbourne reported that, according to an ""internal document prepared by amajor American investment bank, which was circulating in the financialcommunity,"" the rupiah is now a "" 'gaping black hole, there is no alternativeother than the probably violent overthrow of the Government [of PresidentSuharto].' ""            President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, where anothercollapsing currency and hyperinflation provoked food riots this week in thecapital, Harare, was accused in neighboring South Africa of being the solecause of his own misfortunes. The Johannesburg Star said that ""Mugabe's arrogant disregard for the health of theeconomy was astonishing,"" adding that he had failed to consider any of theeconomic consequences of two politically motivated decisions: 1) ordering hisfinance minister to ""find"" the money to pay 50,000 war veterans unbudgetedgratuities and pensions and 2) ordering the seizure of half the country'sprivately owned farmland, most of which was owned by whites.            WhileZimbabwe's Minister of Information Chen Chimutengwende justified theland-seizure plan by saying that ""the government was only protecting whitefarmers from black peasants who, otherwise, would rise up and kill [them],""Mugabe had defiantly stated that he intended to go ahead with the seizures, theStar reported. ""Many Zimbabweans, and many friends of this country, hopehe will pause and rethink his positions on the land issue, the economy anddemocracy,"" it concluded.

It Isn'tAll Relative                        Recentdiscoveries prove that Albert Einstein was indeed the first to explicate thegeneral theory of relativity. Historians of science have long questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea, or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert, who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work. Though Einstein's paper waspublished first, Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations. Einstein, furious, charged Hilbert with plagiarism.Einstein was right. Hilbert's proofs, found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin, reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submission,which were filled in only after Einstein's paper came out. In an article inScience , the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert ""revised his paper in response to Einstein's work."" It's the second bigblow to Hilbert's legacy: His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdel's incompleteness theorem in1931.

The company is poised to begindigging on the dilapidated Nottinghamshire property. Byron scholars areconcerned that the fragile 800-year-old structure (purchased by the Byronfamily from Henry VIII in 1540) might collapse if the excavation proceeds. Thestrongest protests come not from British scholars, however, but from Greekones. Byron, who led the Greek armed forces in their fight for independenceagainst the Ottoman Turks in 1824, is considered a national hero in Greece.Scholars at the University of Athens are leading the campaign to protect theabbey's romantic ruins.

Essays to be deliveredat the conference, which will take place this December in Toronto, include""Oliver Sacks: The P.T. Barnum of the Postmodern World"" and ""Of Angels andPig-Faced Ladies: Disordering Victorian Desire."" Much as feminists championThe Awakening and lesbian-studies scholars vaunt The Well ofLoneliness , disability-studies scholars promise to uncover a slew offounding texts written by the differently abled. One such work is thelong-forgotten 1841 memoir A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings ofWilliam Dodd, a Factory Cripple, Written By Himself . A graduate studentfrom the University of California at Irvine will present an analysis of theLondoner's autobiography at the conference.

It contains four circular punctures that eerily evokea flute. Paleontologist Ivan Turk, who discovered the bone, recently toldScientific American that the four holes are ""really well rounded andjust about the right separation for humans to put their finger on."" And BobFink, a Canadian musicologist, thinks the hole spacing proves that thebone-flute was ""inescapably diatonic,"" suggesting that the eight-tone ""Westernscale"" may be much older than we thought. (His analysisis posted on the Web.) Based on the fragment, Fink speculates that the originalflute contained at least six holes and was close to 16 inches long. Not allanthropologists agree. T. Temple Tuttle, an ethnomusicologist at ClevelandState University, feels the holes conform to ""a number of scales,"" includingthe South Indian system.                           TheEmpire Strikes Back                        Abook-review editor at Science says she was pressured to retire this pastsummer after she published a negative review of a book that claimed to defendscience from postmodern critiques. The review was of Higher Superstition:The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science , written by biologist PaulGross and mathematician Norman Levitt. The article's author, Smithsoniancurator Paul Forman, accused Gross and Levitt of trying to place ""science backon its pre-postmodern pedestal."" After the review was published, Sciencereceived a flood of angry telephone calls and letters, according to the editorin question, Katherine Livingston. (George Mason University's James Trefil, forinstance, complained that Forman ""gets into material he does not appear tounderstand. ... You couldn't possibly have published a better parody of whatpasses for scholarship in the postmodern world."") In an interview with theChronicle for Higher Education , Levitt took credit for launching theletter-writing campaign: ""I was mad as hell that such an irresponsible reviewhad run in Science ,"" he said. After reading the complaints,Science editor in chief Floyd Bloom formally reprimanded Livingston andtook away control of the book-review section.                           EarthLoses Its Balance                        Geologists say that theconcept of continental drift may need to be revised to account for some suddenreshufflings that took place in Earth's past. Basing their theories on evidencefound in magnetite grains in Australian bedrock, researchers at Caltech positthat 550 million years ago, continents at the poles scooted toward the equatorwhile equatorial continents shimmied to the poles, all within a mere 15 millionyears. (Typically, a continental shift takes much longer to complete.) Whatcaused the flip-flop? The stability lent by two opposing supercontinents,Gondwanaland and Rodinia, was disrupted when Rodinia began to fracture. Earth'sbalance was thrown off, and a massive migration was required to regainplanetary equanimity.

Bauer committed                ""the appearance of impropriety.""Unable to produce allegations of impropriety, reporters asked Bauer inaccusatory tones whether he had ""met behind closed doors"" with the aide,Melissa McClard (answer: yes), and whether Bauer's aides had told him ""thatpeople are asking questions [about it] and it's making people uncomfortable.""When Bauer challenged a reporter to define the alleged ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the reporter replied, ""That you were seen too often with a woman onyour campaign, who is described to me as being 26 years old and blond."" Anotherreporter accused Bauer of being ""ambiguous, because you're not really tellingus ... can you understand the perception that you may have had an affair?"" HowBauer could refute such perceptions, questions, and discomfort was equallyambiguous.            Twoalleged Bauer accusers, former aides Charles Jarvis and Tim McDonald, finallywent on the record Wednesday. Jarvis said he had no proof of a sexualrelationship between Bauer and McClard, and McDonald said he believed Bauer'sdenial of such a relationship. Rather than conclude that there was no story,the Washington Post published an article, headlined""Ex-Aides to Bauer Speak Out,"" which paraphrased the two men as saying Bauer'smeetings with McClard ""looked"" inappropriate and ""lent themselves to gossip andrumor."" The Post quoted Jarvis as saying Bauer ""has no business creatingthat kind of appearance of impropriety.""                           2. The                appearance of impropriety by a Christianconservative is itself improper. A Post reporter pressed Bauer abouthis closed-door meetings with McClard: ""Billy Graham doesn't do it, JamesDobson doesn't do it. So [among] the people who you are close to, actually,there is a sensitivity about meeting with women behind closed doors. I'mnot saying there should be one. I don't think there should. But there isone."" Thursday's Post reported that Jarvis and McDonald ""said Bauerspent hours behind closed doors with her and traveled alone with her, violatingthe strict rules they believe govern conservative Christian married men intheir dealings with women."" By framing the issue as ""sensitivity,"" thePost avoided taking responsibility for deeming Bauer's closed-doormeetings an important issue.                           3. Bauer                appeared to ignore allegations of the appearanceof impropriety. ""Is it possible,"" a reporter asked Bauer, ""that you mayhave been engaging in behavior that was perfectly innocent [but] in the mindsof the people who work for you and respected you was inappropriate, and thatperhaps you--as it was put by someone to me--you appeared a little arrogant inrefusing to recognize, according to them, their complaints?"" In other words,Bauer's offense is that he dismissed a perception he knew to be false.                           4. Bauer                is covering up allegations of the appearance ofimpropriety. Reporters asked Bauer whether aides had told him they were""uncomfortable"" about the appearance of his relationship with McClard. Onereporter asked whether Bauer's former secretary had told him, ""I wish youwouldn't behave this way with this woman."" When Bauer challenged the reporterto explain the meaning of ""behave this way,"" the reporter admitted, ""I don'tknow.""            Bauerdenied that his aides had alleged actual impropriety: ""No one leaving mycampaign has said, 'Gary, I am leaving your campaign because I believe you'rehaving an affair.' "" He also denied that any perception of impropriety could bejustified: ""I cannot imagine that anybody in a campaign would object to mehaving a meeting behind closed doors with a professional woman."" ThePost , seizing on the latter remark, reported that Jarvis ""sharplydisputed Bauer."" The sad truth, Jarvis told the Post , was that ""peoplehave confronted Gary about the appearance of impropriety."" Similarly,USAToday quoted Jarvis as saying, ""Gary Bauer just went on nationaltelevision and refused to tell the truth."" And what was that truth? That Jarvisand others had quit the campaign because of their ""concerns about therelationship""--whatever that means.                           5. Bauer                improperly failed to confront the person whoapparently alleged the appearance of impropriety. ""One would think,"" onereporter lectured Bauer, ""when you found that the source appeared to be [theForbes] campaign, that you would go directly to the head of that campaign andsay, 'Is this happening? Are you people doing this?' "" Another reporter chimedin, ""For folks who are not presidential candidates, if somebody was spreadingrumors like that about them, I think the first instinct would be to go to thesuspected source and say, 'Are you doing this? And if so, please stop it.' Whydidn't you do that?""                           6. Bauer                failed to disprove the possibility ofimpropriety. Unable to formulate a precise allegation, one reporter askedBauer whether his behavior with McClard had been ""flirtatious or in any waydifferent from how you interact with other aides"" (answer: no). When Bauerchallenged another questioner to explain what he meant by ""inappropriatebehavior,"" the questioner replied, ""How specific do you want to get? I'm notsure I understand what you want."" Responding to Bauer's assertion that he hadnever violated his wedding vows, another reporter cracked, ""President Clintonsaid that too."" Thursday's Chicago Tribune reported that Bauer ""would not go muchfurther than indicating he was faithful to his wife."" The collectiveimplication is that Bauer's denials must have been couched to protect someunspecified kind of dalliance.                           7. Every                a               llegation is a politicalfact. Horse-race journalism ignores whether charges are true and focusesinstead on whether they're damaging. The first question to Bauer Wednesday was,""Don't you just give this story more momentum by doing this?"" Another reporterasked, ""How do you think your supporters are going to respond to all this?"" ThePost , too scrupulous to say whether Bauer had done anything wrong oreven whether the perception that he might have done so would hurt himpolitically, found one political scientist who ""warned that Bauer could befatally wounded, in political terms, by the dispute"" and another who ""saidBauer could help himself by saying, 'I wish I wouldn't have put myself in thiskind of situation, I'm sorry and I apologize.' "" Whether the ""situation"" was amisdeed or a perception was left unexplained. The LosAngeles Times told readers that ""the real news was the wall-to-wallpress throng"" at the news conference.                           8. Bauer                showed bad judgment by letting the allegations ofan appearance of impropriety become a political problem. A Salonreporter told Bauer, ""A lot of us have heard this rumor. But to be quitehonest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it andprobably didn't take it very seriously. But you've now elevated it to a pointthat it will be on the evening news. And a lot of Americans, when they arefirst introduced to you ... it will be for that--for denying an affair. Whatdoes that say about your political judgment?"" Within hours, Salonpublished the reporter's derisive story about the press conference, titled""Bauer: I am not a slut!""            Theproblem isn't that the media are malicious or are out to get Bauer. I know andlike at least two of the reporters who asked some of the most loaded questionsat the press conference. The problem is that they can't resist a hot story. Asex scandal on the religious right, no matter how flimsy, seems too good topass up. Reporters think they have to ask the killer question or advance thestory, never mind which way it's going. The campaign is in overdrive, theirprey stands before them, and the heat of the moment carries them away. Theywonder whether Gary Bauer is strong enough to resist the urge. They should askthe same question of themselves.                  ",Sensitivity Official,[],"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts"
