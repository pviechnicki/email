I >t's exhilarating to see this stuff","priority":"Normal","contentType":"multipart/alternative","sentDate":"2017-11-06T23:56:23","importance":"Normal","plainTextBody":"\r\n   \r\n   \r\n      \r\n         \r\n            Girlie Men\r\n\r\n            Everybody knows that Paris\r\nis the realm of fashion, fashion is the realm of artifice, and both are the\r\nrealm of women. This year as always, Paris fashion has meant fabulous-looking\r\ngirls slinking along in foot-high hair or plastered-flat hair with grim or\r\ngiddy hats and stark painted faces, sporting fitted tops, transparent tops,\r\ncutout tops, tight skirts slit to here, full skirts trailing to there, floppy\r\npants or skinny pants, trimmings that glitter or flutter, colors that dazzle or\r\npuzzle, curled feathers and dyed fur, boiled wool and frosted leather, crushed\r\nvelvet, shot silk, frayed hemp, and distressed plastic. Such displays are to be\r\nexpected in Paris, as part of the traditional French insistence that Eve has\r\nthe right to cut and shape her fig leaf, edge it with spangled lace, and\r\nlacquer it black. If you want Adam's fig leaf in its natural material, go to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n            Or so legend has it.\r\nBritish understatement set the universal standard for male elegance in 1800,\r\nand it's holding its own two centuries later. When Beau Brummell said, \"If you\r\nnoticed me, I wasn't well-dressed,\" he put an end to purple feathers and\r\ncrimson velvet for men all over the Western world, and that was that, right\r\ndown to all the Similar Sober Suits at summit meetings.\r\n\r\n            But\r\nmen, apparently, are getting tired of being inconspicuous. With no loss of\r\nbeauty and status (men's suits are just as becoming as they ever were), perfect\r\nmale tailoring has lost some of its virile edge. No wonder, since the strongest\r\ntheme in modern women's fashion has been the creative theft of the male\r\nwardrobe, with all its components translated into terms of conspicuous\r\nseduction. How can men's fashion respond to this?\r\n\r\n            Paris has the answer: Just take it back, and take it\r\nfurther. Paris today--and Milan and New York, always hoping to outdo Paris--is\r\noffering men's fashion shows of unexpected glamour, color, and sexuality,\r\nfounding a new theater that could someday rival its feminine equivalent,\r\napplying Eve's method to Adam. In the this year's fall collections, designers\r\nfor men were using the same trousers and shorts, shirts and sweaters, coats and\r\njackets that women had already rescued from British decorum and boldly\r\ndistorted for themselves. The menswear shows deployed a similar\r\nsuggestiveness--a form-fitting shape, a brazen inventiveness of texture and\r\nhue, a daring sweep of cuff, collar, and coattail, all totally forbidden by\r\nSaville Row, but gloriously worked up for women during the last 30 years by the\r\nlikes of Yves Saint Laurent.\r\n\r\n            Here\r\nthere's a fur scarf or some extra drapery added to the neck of a man's suit;\r\nthere there's a man's raincoat in metallic fabric that moves in a million\r\nglittering folds. There's a man's svelte blazer tailored in a red-flowered\r\nivory brocade. There are also references to 17 th -century pirates,\r\nArabian \r\n               Nights sultans, Regency bucks, fin-de-si?cle\r\ndandies and depraved noblemen of the ancien r(gime .\r\n\r\n            \r\n               I >t's\r\nexhilarating to see this stuff back on men, and not just in the movies. The\r\nmodels look magnificent, especially the ones working for Vivienne Westwood and\r\nJean-Paul Gaultier, who have joyfully reveled in creating extreme artifice for\r\nboth sexes. Gaultier's male models wear full makeup and pencil mustaches with\r\ntheir finery, and they smolder with conviction. The ones from Masaki Matsushima\r\neven smolder in silvery 18 th -century wigs, and one Moschino model\r\nwore a blue Louis XV wig with a blue denim ensemble, his face a charming study\r\nin irony. Yohji Yamamoto uses tragic-faced models, some bald, middle-aged, and\r\nnot so slim, on whom his quasi-Middle Eastern robes, coats, and headgear look\r\nnearly noble. Many comely youths, on the other hand, look much like Shelley's\r\nportrait, with flowing locks and tender throats exposed above their soft suede\r\nsuits.\r\n\r\n            The\r\nwhole display vividly depicts what men have envied for so long. For\r\ngenerations, they had to look tough, modest, honest, and restrained under plain\r\nsuits or plain sportswear. Masculinity was allowed no erotic range in dress;\r\nthe phallic necktie, licensed to reflect light and glow with color, was\r\nfamously men's only hope. Every expressive shape or shiny streak in a coat and\r\nsuit bore the dread suggestion of effeminacy, connoting both a lack of\r\nintegrity and an unbridled vanity felt to be unavoidable in women, but\r\ncriminal, even thuggish, in men. And so the free play of fantasy died out of\r\nmen's clothes. Revived fantasy has tended in one direction only, which means\r\nthat lately, there's been more than enough black leather, harsh metal, and\r\nshaved hair. Maybe now that sexual ambiguity is recognized as a potent force,\r\nwe can begin to see men in gold embroidery and sweeping folds of silk.\r\n\r\n            Long habits die hard, though. Most men's fashion shows\r\nstill concentrate on exquisite variations of the formal and sporty classics,\r\nwith plenty of subtle colors, beautiful cravats and very discreet historical\r\nreferences. Male models still can't carry off the gaudy stuff. They lurch\r\nuncomfortably along the catwalk, imprisoned in a tradition of artlessness.\r\nSkirts show no sign of appearing on the man in the street, although Gaultier\r\nhas been promoting them for years. His most recent catwalk version was a sari\r\nwrapped around the waist under a jacket, falling to the instep and swinging\r\nwith the wearer's manly stride. Very nice, but not likely to catch on until men\r\nfinally remember the comfortable tunics of the very distant past.\r\n\r\n            Men have already recovered\r\nthe masculine long hair, jewelry, and purses of medieval times. Skirts may\r\nappear some day (that's a prediction) but probably with a military flavor, the\r\nkind built into the Scottish kilt or the battle dress of Roman soldiers.\r\nMeanwhile, lovers of spectacle will have to content themselves with drag, which\r\ngives intermittent delight to its watchers and wearers, even if so far, it\r\nhasn't made an appearance at summit meetings.\r\n\r\n
