Furthermore, phagocytosis of photoreceptor\r\n        outer segments by RPE causes an increase in intracellular [\r\n        2 ] and extracellular H \r\n        2 O \r\n        2 generation [ 3 ] . Oxidative stress\r\n        has been suggested as the cause of a number of retinal\r\n        pathological conditions [ 4 5 ] .\r\n        A number of \r\n        in vitro studies have attempted to\r\n        characterize the effect of oxidative stress on RPE.\r\n        Depending on the experimental conditions, treatment of RPE\r\n        with H \r\n        2 O \r\n        2 can cause an alteration of cellular\r\n        functions [ 6 7 ] or cell death [ 8 9 ] . Cytotoxic levels\r\n        of H \r\n        2 O \r\n        2 can cause significant mitochondrial [\r\n        10 ] and genomic [ 11 ] DNA damage in RPE simulating the\r\n        features of programmed cell death [ 8 12 ] . Studies from\r\n        other cell types indicate that early cellular events\r\n        following H \r\n        2 O \r\n        2 treatment include morphological\r\n        alterations and actin re-organization [ 13 ] . In addition,\r\n        activation of the ERK (p42/44, Extracellular\r\n        signal-Regulated Kinase) MAP kinases (Mitogen-Activated\r\n        Protein kinases) can occur within minutes following\r\n        cellular oxidative stress. Depending on the cell type\r\n        examined, inhibition of the ERK activity can either prevent\r\n        [ 14 ] or enhance H \r\n        2 O \r\n        2 -induced cell death [ 15 ] . The\r\n        involvement of actin re-organization and ERK activation has\r\n        not been examined in RPE under oxidative stress.\r\n        Lipid peroxidation products, such as 4-hydroxynonenal\r\n        (4-HNE), have attracted considerable attention because of\r\n        their potential involvement in aging and in a number of\r\n        neuropathological conditions [ 16 ] . 4-HNE was implicated\r\n        in the etiology of some pathological conditions in the eye.\r\n        For example, levels of 4-HNE increased significantly in the\r\n        vitreous of patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy\r\n        compared with controls [ 17 ] . Further, 4-HNE forms a\r\n        stable adduct with rhodopsin in the photoreceptor, which\r\n        may interfere with its functions [ 18 ] . 4-HNE even causes\r\n        cataracts in cultured rat lens [ 19 20 ] . Whether\r\n        oxidative stress on RPE can cause accumulation of cellular\r\n        HNE-protein adducts remains unknown.\r\n        Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)\r\n        belong to a group of nuclear receptors that include\r\n        steroid, retinoid, thyroid hormone receptors and others [\r\n        21 22 23 ] . There are three types of PPARs: PPAR? is\r\n        expressed predominantly in the liver, heart, kidney, brown\r\n        adipose and stomach mucosa, and is important for lipid\r\n        catabolism. PPAR? is found in adipose tissues and is\r\n        important for adipogenesis. PPAR? is found in most tissues,\r\n        but its role is less well defined. RPE cells express all\r\n        three forms of PPARs but PPAR? is the dominant isoform [ 24\r\n        ] . There is a 10-fold induction of PPAR? mRNA that reaches\r\n        a peak at 4-hour after phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer\r\n        segments. The levels of either PPAR? mRNA or PPAR? mRNA are\r\n        not altered under the same conditions. Increases in PPAR?\r\n        in RPE cells may be important for handling the lipids\r\n        generated during the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer\r\n        segments [ 24 ] . Since RPE cells generate large amounts of\r\n        H \r\n        2 O \r\n        2 during the phagocytosis of\r\n        photoreceptor outer segments, there is a possibility that\r\n        activation of PPAR? may assist in defending the oxidative\r\n        stress associated with phagocytosis.\r\n        This study was designed to examine morphological\r\n        alterations in RPE during oxidative stress, the involvement\r\n        of ERK MAP kinase and 4-HNE and to test the hypothesis that\r\n        PPAR? activation can prevent oxidative damage on RPE cells.\r\n        The human RPE cell line, ARPE-19, and primary cultures of\r\n        adult human RPE were used in this study. ARPE-19 is a\r\n        spontaneous occurring, non-transformed RPE cell line which\r\n        expresses RPE specific markers (such as CRALBP and RPE65)\r\n        and exhibits morphological polarization and tight junctions\r\n        similar to native RPE [ 25 26 ] .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Methods\r\n        \r\n          Materials\r\n          WY14643, 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 , azelaoyl PAF and ciglitazone were\r\n          purchased from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). LY 171883 was\r\n          purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). AG126\r\n          and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego,\r\n          CA). Hydrogen peroxide and other pharmacological and\r\n          general biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma\r\n          (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Cell cultures\r\n          \r\n          ARPE-19 cells [ 25 ] were obtained\r\n          from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in\r\n          DMEM/F12 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine\r\n          serum and 2.5 mM glutamine. \r\n          Human primary RPE cultures were\r\n          established from donor eyes obtained from the Arkansas\r\n          Lions Eye Bank & Laboratory. The globe was sectioned\r\n          at the ora serrata, and the lens and vitreous body were\r\n          removed. The eye cup was then filled with 4% dispase\r\n          (prepared in DMEM) containing 1? antibiotic-antimycotic\r\n          reagents (final concentrations: 100 units/ml Penicillin\r\n          G, 100 ?g/ml Streptomycin and 0.25 ?g/ml Amphotericin B)\r\n          and incubated in a 37?C incubator with 5% CO \r\n          2 for ~30 minutes. RPE cells were then\r\n          removed under a dissecting microscope, dissociated by\r\n          trituration using a Pasteur pipette, and then plated on\r\n          poly-L-lysine (25 mg/liter in water) coated 35-cm\r\n          2culture dishes. The cell population was then expanded by\r\n          sequentially subculturing into 25-cm 2tissue culture\r\n          flasks, then to 75-cm 2tissue culture flasks. Cells of\r\n          passages #3-#6 were used for this study. The culture\r\n          medium consisted of 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine\r\n          serum, 2.5 mM glutamine and 1? antibiotic-antimycotic\r\n          reagents in DMEM.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Cell viability\r\n          Cells were plated in 96-well plates (human primary\r\n          RPE: 10,000 cells/well, ARPE-19: 15,000-20,000\r\n          cells/well, unless otherwise stated) overnight, fed with\r\n          serum-free medium or treated with testing agents\r\n          (prepared in serum-free medium) the next day followed by\r\n          H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment for a day, then the\r\n          viability from each treatment was determined by the MTT\r\n          (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium\r\n          bromide) assay [ 27 ] . Culture medium was removed after\r\n          treatment and then 100 ?l MTT solution (100 ?g/ml\r\n          prepared in DMEM) was added to each well. The cultures\r\n          were incubated at 37?C for one hour in a tissue culture\r\n          incubator. The MTT solution was then removed and the\r\n          cells in each well were lysed by the addition of 100 ?l\r\n          dimethyl sulfoxide. The plate was placed on a shaker for\r\n          one hour at room temperature to complete the lysing\r\n          process, then the optical density of each well was\r\n          measured by a 96-well plate reader with a filter setting\r\n          at 570 nm (reference filter setting was 630 nm). When a\r\n          pharmacological agent was used in the experiment, the MTT\r\n          reading from cultures treated with that agent alone was\r\n          used as 100% cellular viability.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Actin staining\r\n          This was performed as described by Carter et al. [ 28\r\n          ] . Cells grown on coverslips were treated with H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 for various period of time as\r\n          indicated in figure legends, washed three times with\r\n          phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then fixed for 10\r\n          minutes with 3.7% formaldehyde (prepared in PBS). The\r\n          cultures were then washed three times with PBS, extracted\r\n          with -20?C acetone for 5 minutes followed by three washes\r\n          with PBS. Each culture was then stained with Texas\r\n          Red-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) prepared in\r\n          PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 minutes at\r\n          room temperature in a lightproof box. The cultures were\r\n          then washed three times with water, mounted with\r\n          GEL/MOUNT (Biomedia, Foster City, CA). The slides were\r\n          examined under a Nikon microscope Eclipse E600 (Nikon\r\n          Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). Cells were photographed\r\n          digitally at a fixed exposure time by using a\r\n          Photometrics CoolSNAP fx camera (Roper Scientific, Inc.,\r\n          Tucson, AZ) and the software MetaVue, Meta Imaging Series\r\n          4.5 (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent\r\n          staining\r\n          Cultures grown on coverslips were used in this set of\r\n          experiments. Phospho-ERK was detected by mouse\r\n          anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,\r\n          Santa Cruz, CA, used at 1:1500) and the Vectastain ABC\r\n          kit (Vector Lab., Burlingame, CA) with diaminobenzidine\r\n          as the chromogen. Cellular 4-HNE protein adducts were\r\n          detected by rabbit anti-4-HNE antibodies (Calbiochem, San\r\n          Diego, CA, used at 1:250) followed by anti-rabbit\r\n          secondary antibody labeled with FITC (Dako Corporation,\r\n          Carpinteria, CA). The cultures were then mounted with\r\n          GEL/MOUNT. The slides were examined under Nikon\r\n          microscope Eclipse E600 (Nikon Instruments Inc.,\r\n          Melville, NY). Cells were photographed at fixed exposure\r\n          time with Nikon digital still camera DXM 1200 (Nikon\r\n          Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) and the software Nikon\r\n          ACT-1 version 2.11 (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Nuclear staining\r\n          Cells grown on coverslips were treated with H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 for various periods of time as\r\n          indicated in figure legends, fixed for 10 minutes with\r\n          3.7% formaldehyde (prepared in PBS), stained with 1 ?g/ml\r\n          bisbenzimide solution (Hoechst 33258, Sigma, St. Louis,\r\n          MO) for 10 minutes at room temperature, mounted with\r\n          GEL/MOUNT, then observed under a fluorescent microscope\r\n          as described in the previous section.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Western blot analysis\r\n          RPE cells were plated in T-150 flasks overnight, fed\r\n          with serum-free medium for a day, then treated with H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 as indicated in figure legends. For\r\n          sample preparation, cultures were detached with a scraper\r\n          in PBS then centrifuged. The cell pellets were suspended\r\n          in 150-300 ?l ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 0.5%\r\n          Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in PBS, 0.5 mM\r\n          Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.02 mg/ml\r\n          Aprotinin, 1 mM Na \r\n          3 VO \r\n          4 ) and incubated for 30 min on ice.\r\n          Each sample was further homogenized by passage through a\r\n          21-gauge needle followed by an addition of 10 ?l PMSF\r\n          (stock solution: 50 mM). The samples were then incubated\r\n          for 30 min on ice and subsequently centrifuged at 14,000\r\n          RPM for 20 min at 4?C. The supernatant from each sample\r\n          was collected and an aliquot was taken for protein\r\n          concentration determination by Micro BCA Protein Assay\r\n          Reagent Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Protein samples were\r\n          stored at -70?C until ready for electrophoretic analysis.\r\n          Equal amounts of protein samples (20 ?g/well) were heated\r\n          at 95?C for 6 min then loaded onto 1% SDS, 10%\r\n          polyacrylamide gels. BenchMark pre-stained protein ladder\r\n          (Invitrogen life technologies, Carlsbad, California) was\r\n          used as molecular weight standards. Following\r\n          electrophoretic separation, the proteins were transferred\r\n          to nitrocellulose membranes. Equal loading and\r\n          appropriate transfer of each lane was confirmed by\r\n          staining the membrane with the Ponceau S solution (Sigma,\r\n          St. Louis, MO). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried\r\n          milk for one hour, washed in 10 mM Tris-buffered saline\r\n          (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) and probed with\r\n          primary antibody overnight at 4?C. Membranes were washed\r\n          with TBST and then incubated for 1 hour at room\r\n          temperature with a secondary antibody followed by washing\r\n          three times with TBST, immersed in ECL Plus western\r\n          blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,\r\n          Buckinghamshire, England) for 1 min and then exposed to\r\n          Kodak X-ray film (Rochester, NY). The films were analyzed\r\n          by densitometry using a ChemiImager 5500 imaging system\r\n          with AlphaEaseFC software (Alpha Innotech Corporation,\r\n          San Leandro, CA). Results, expressed as percentage of\r\n          control, from replicate experiments were pooled and\r\n          averaged. The primary antibodies used in this set of\r\n          experiments were from Santa Cruz (anti-ERK 1/2, used at\r\n          1:5000; anti-phospho-ERK, used at 1:1000; anti-PPAR?,\r\n          used at 1:2000) or from Calbiochem (anti-4-HNE, used at\r\n          1:2,000).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Statistical analysis\r\n          Unless otherwise stated, results of cell viability\r\n          experiments were pooled from 12 replicate samples derived\r\n          from 3 independent experiments, and expressed as mean ?\r\n          SEM. Statistical analyses were performed by analysis of\r\n          variance (one-way ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni test\r\n          to determine the significance of difference.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Results\r\n        \r\n          Cytotoxicity of H 2O 2toward primary human RPE and\r\n          ARPE-19 cells\r\n          Initial experiments analyzing the cytotoxic effect of\r\n          oxidative stress on primary cultures of human RPE cells\r\n          indicated that H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 at 1 mM or less did not affect\r\n          cellular viability. Higher concentrations caused a sharp\r\n          decrease of viability in human RPE such that a 24-hour\r\n          treatment of cells with 1.2 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 lowered the viability to 13% of\r\n          controls (Fig. 1A, squares). This concentration lowered\r\n          the viability of human RPE to 62% after a 4-hour\r\n          treatment (Fig. 1A, circles).\r\n          In a set of analogous experiments, ARPE-19 cells\r\n          treated with various concentrations of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 for 4 hours or 24 hours showed that\r\n          a 4-hour treatment with 1 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 did not affect viability. An\r\n          increase of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 concentrations beyond 1 mM decreased\r\n          viability such as 2 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 decreased the viability to 46% of\r\n          controls in 4 hours (Fig. 1B, circles). Treatment of\r\n          cells with H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 for 24 hours caused a dose-dependent\r\n          decrease of viability with a LD \r\n          50 of ~1.35 mM (Fig. 1B, squares).\r\n          H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 induced cytotoxicity in RPE cells\r\n          appears to be affected by the density of cells in\r\n          cultures [ 29 ] . To study this phenomenon, ARPE-19 cells\r\n          plated in 96-well plates with densities of 10,000, 20,000\r\n          or 40,000 cells/well were subjected to H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment. Cells grown in a\r\n          high-density culture were indeed more resistant to H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 as compared to those grown in a\r\n          low-density culture (Fig. 1C). For example, H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 at 1.4 mM reduced cellular viability\r\n          to 11%, 49% or 94% of control in cultures with 10,000,\r\n          20,000 or 40,000 cells/well, respectively.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          H 2O 2induced morphological alterations and\r\n          formation of 4-HNE-adducts\r\n          To analyze morphological changes of RPE cells treated\r\n          with a cytotoxic concentration of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 , ARPE-19 cells were treated with\r\n          1.5 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 for various periods of time and then\r\n          processed for actin staining. Without H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment, stress fibers appeared\r\n          thin and diffuse in control cells (Fig. 2A, arrow). At\r\n          15-min after treatment, these cells appeared to round up\r\n          and significant ruffling occurred at the edge of their\r\n          plasma membrane (Fig. 2B, arrows). Overall thickening of\r\n          stress fibers occurred at two hours after treatment in\r\n          addition to the membrane ruffling (Fig. 2C, arrows).\r\n          Additional morphological changes after 4 hours of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment (Fig. 2D,2E,2F) included\r\n          distinctive dense bands at the periphery of some cells\r\n          (Fig. 2D, arrows), peri-nuclear staining of actin fibers\r\n          in other cells (which made the nuclei prominent, Fig. 2E,\r\n          arrows) and microspikes (Fig. 2F, arrow) on the cell\r\n          surface of some cells.\r\n          Subsequent experiments with immunofluorescent staining\r\n          indicated that 1.5 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment of ARPE-19 cells for 4\r\n          hours led to the formation of 4-HNE protein adducts both\r\n          in the cytoplasm and nucleus, presumably as a result of\r\n          lipid-peroxidation (Fig. 3A,3B). Various protein bands on\r\n          Western blots were positive for anti-HNE antibody\r\n          reactivity, further intensified as a result of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment (Fig 3C). Densitometry\r\n          measurements were performed to estimate the collective\r\n          increase of band intensity in each lane between 39 Kd and\r\n          87 Kd. Results derived from a total of six independent\r\n          experiments indicated that treatment of cells with 0.5,\r\n          1, 1.5 or 2 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 caused an increase of intensity to\r\n          2.5-, 3.1-, 3.7- or 7.1-fold of control,\r\n          respectively.\r\n          Though there was significant cytoskeletal alterations\r\n          and lipid peroxidation at 4 hours after H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment, nuclear staining using\r\n          bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258) indicated that most cells\r\n          maintained normal nuclear morphology at this time (Fig.\r\n          4A, untreated cells; Fig. 4B, 4 hours after treatment).\r\n          Nuclear condensation increased with length of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 exposure, which was clearly evident\r\n          at 12 hours after H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment (Fig 4C, arrows), and even\r\n          more prominent at 16 hours after treatment (Fig. 4D).\r\n          These results suggest that H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment caused apoptosis in RPE.\r\n          Nuclear condensation appeared to start at the edge of the\r\n          culture (relatively lower density area, Fig. 4C, arrows)\r\n          and spread to the center part of the culture (higher\r\n          density, Fig. 4D) over time. This phenomenon is\r\n          consistent with the viability assay in which higher\r\n          density cultures were more resistant to oxidative stress\r\n          (Fig. 1C).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Effect of oxidative stress on PPAR? protein\r\n          expression\r\n          During rod outer segment ingestion, there is a\r\n          generation of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 [ 2 3 ] and an up-regulation of\r\n          PPAR? mRNA expression [ 24 ] in RPE, experiments were\r\n          performed to determine if H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 could induce PPAR? protein\r\n          expression over the control levels. ARPE-19 cells were\r\n          treated with various concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mM)\r\n          of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 for 24 hours and processed for\r\n          Western blot analysis. Results indicated a slight\r\n          induction of PPAR? protein levels in some experiments.\r\n          This induction, however, was not apparent in other\r\n          experiments (Results not shown). Densitometry analyses\r\n          from a total of six independent experiments indicated\r\n          that treatment of these cells with 0.5, 1, 1.5 or 2 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 for 24 hours caused an alteration of\r\n          band intensity to 76%, 108%, 113% or 104% of controls,\r\n          respectively. There was no significant change of PPAR?\r\n          protein level after 30-min or 12-hour H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment, either (results not\r\n          shown). A separate set of experiments also indicated that\r\n          treatment of primary human RPE cells with 1 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 for 24 hours did not induce PPAR?\r\n          protein expression over the control levels (results not\r\n          shown).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Prevention of oxidative stress induced cytotoxicity\r\n          by PPAR? agonists\r\n          Even though H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 did not increase PPAR? protein\r\n          expression significantly as indicated in the previous\r\n          study, experiments were performed to determine whether\r\n          PPAR? agonists could activate the existing PPAR? thus\r\n          preventing H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 induced cytotoxicity in RPE cells.\r\n          Cells were pretreated with the PPAR? agonist 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 overnight followed by H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 for one day (without 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 ) and processed for the MTT\r\n          viability assay. Results indicated that 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 prevented H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 induced cytotoxicity in primary\r\n          human RPE cultures in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A).\r\n          Subsequent experiments with ARPE-19 cells also indicated\r\n          this saving effect. While H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 at 1.3 mM, 1.4 mM or 1.5 mM lowered\r\n          the ARPE-19 viability to 64%, 46% or 28% of control,\r\n          respectively; pretreatment of these cells with 1 ?M\r\n          15d-PGJ \r\n          2 raised the viabilities to 95%, 84%\r\n          or 68% of control, respectively (Fig. 5B). Cells stained\r\n          with Hoechst 33258 indicated that 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 prevented H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 induced nuclear condensation (Fig.\r\n          4E; compare this with Fig. 4D). The other PPAR? agonists,\r\n          ciglitazone [ 30 ] , azelaoyl PAF [ 31 ] and LY171883 [\r\n          32 ] , however, were not effective (tested between 1-10\r\n          ?M, 3 independent experiments for each agent, results not\r\n          shown). The PPAR? agonist WY14643 had some saving effect\r\n          at a high concentration (40 ?M), however, the difference\r\n          was not statistically significant (results not\r\n          shown).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Activation of ERK by H 2O 2\r\n          A set of experiments was performed to determine the\r\n          effects of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 on ERK activation. ARPE-19 cells\r\n          were treated with 1.5 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 for 1 hour and processed for\r\n          immunohistochemical staining using antibodies against\r\n          phospho-ERK. Untreated cells showed a faint phospho-ERK\r\n          staining while there was an apparent increase of\r\n          phospho-ERK staining in the cytoplasm and nuclei in H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treated cells (Fig. 6A,6B). A\r\n          separate set of cultures was treated with H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 for 30 min and then processed for\r\n          Western blot analysis. This H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment of the cells caused only a\r\n          slight alteration in ERK levels but led to a\r\n          dose-dependent increase of phospho-ERK, with a maximal\r\n          stimulation observed at 1.5 mM (Fig. 6C). Densitometry\r\n          analyses from 3 independent experiments indicated that\r\n          0.5, 1, 1.5 or 2 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 caused an increase of p42ERK (ERK2)\r\n          phosphorylation to 2.1-, 12.7-, 18.8- or 2.0- fold of\r\n          control, respectively. Similar treatment caused an\r\n          increase of p44 ERK (ERK1) phosphorylation to 1.5-,\r\n          15.7-, 21.4- or 3.4-fold of control, respectively. The\r\n          phospho-ERK in H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treated samples remained higher than\r\n          control at 24-hour after treatment (results not\r\n          shown).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Effect of ERK inhibition on H 2O 2induced\r\n          cytotoxicity in ARPE-19\r\n          Since ERK activation appeared to be an early event\r\n          associated with H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 induced cytotoxicity, experiments\r\n          were performed to determine if inhibitors of ERK\r\n          activation could affect the cytotoxicity caused by H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 . ARPE-19 cells were pretreated with\r\n          10 ?M PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor which functions upstream\r\n          of ERK [ 33 ] ) followed by H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 challenge. Results from 3\r\n          independent experiments indicated that this agent could\r\n          prevent low-dose (1-1.2 mM) H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 induced cell death slightly. In\r\n          contrast, it enhanced high-dose (1.3-1.6 mM) H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 induced cell death. These effects in\r\n          either case were not remarkable (results not shown). This\r\n          agent at concentrations higher than 10 ?M was toxic to\r\n          ARPE-19 cells by itself and could enhance H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 toxicity (results not shown).\r\n          In a separate set of experiments, ARPE-19 cells were\r\n          pretreated with 10 ?M AG126 (a protein tyrosine kinase\r\n          inhibitor [ 34 ] ) followed by H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 challenge. The treatment of cells\r\n          with 1.3 mM, 1.4 mM or 1.5 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 decreased the cellular viability to\r\n          66%, 40% or 22% of control, respectively. Pretreatment of\r\n          cells with AG126 raised the viability to 72% (p < 0.05\r\n          compared to H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment only), 63% (p < 0.005)\r\n          or 35% (p < 0.01) of control, respectively. AG126 at\r\n          concentrations higher than 10 ?M was toxic to ARPE-19\r\n          cells by itself and could enhance H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 toxicity (results not shown).\r\n          Both AG126 (10 ?M) and 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 (1 ?M) could prevent H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 induced cytotoxicity in ARPE-19, a\r\n          set of experiments was also performed to determine\r\n          whether these two agents had additive saving effects.\r\n          While 1.4 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment reduced the viability to\r\n          ~40% of control, AG126 raised this viability to ~55% of\r\n          control and 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 raised the viability to 75% of\r\n          control. A combination of these two agents did not raise\r\n          the viability above 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 alone (Fig. 7).\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Discussion\r\n        \r\n          Cytotoxicity of oxidative stress on RPE\r\n          Results from this study indicated that both primary\r\n          human RPE cultures and ARPE-19 cells were susceptible to\r\n          H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment. It is important to point\r\n          out that H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 showed a very steep dose-response\r\n          curve in primary RPE cultures under our experimental\r\n          conditions such that an increase of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 concentration from 1 mM to 1.2 mM\r\n          for one-day treatment caused a decrease in viability from\r\n          ~100% to ~10% of control (Fig. 1A). Though the H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 titration curve in ARPE-19 was not\r\n          as steep as observed in primary RPE, one-day treatment of\r\n          these cells with 1.8 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 could decrease the cellular\r\n          viability to ~10% of control while 1 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 did not affect cellular viability\r\n          (Fig. 1B). The sharp dose-response curves demonstrated in\r\n          this study suggests that it is important to have an\r\n          effective cellular anti-oxidation mechanism to prevent\r\n          the build-up of oxidative stress over a critical level.\r\n          An increase of oxidative stress in RPE is associated with\r\n          an increase of cellular catalase, metallothionein [ 3 ]\r\n          and glutathione S-transferase [ 35 ] , which should serve\r\n          as a protective mechanism to decrease the cytotoxicity\r\n          caused by H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 and other reactive oxygen species.\r\n          This protective mechanism declines with age because a\r\n          study analyzing metallothionein levels in RPE of macular\r\n          region showed a dramatic decrease in aged donors (mean\r\n          age = 80-yr) as compared to those from younger donors\r\n          (mean age = 58-yr) [ 36 ] . A separate report concluded\r\n          that there was also an age-dependent decrease of catalase\r\n          activity in RPE [ 37 ] . These studies suggest RPE in the\r\n          elderly are more susceptible to oxidative stress induced\r\n          damage, which may contribute to age-related RPE\r\n          dysfunction and vision loss. The oxidative stress induced\r\n          RPE cytotoxicity can be aggravated by zinc deficiency, as\r\n          previously reported by Tate et al. [ 9 ] .\r\n          Significant morphological changes were observed in RPE\r\n          cells treated with a cytotoxic concentration of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 . Actin fiber re-organization was\r\n          noticed as early as 15 minutes after treatment (Fig. 2).\r\n          Those images presented in Fig. 2D,2Eand 2Fare three\r\n          representatives of RPE cells at 4 hr after H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment. The cells shown in 2D and\r\n          2F are commonly seen at different locations on the same\r\n          slide. In Fig. 2D, the dense peripheral bands of actin\r\n          fibers were very prominent in some cells and the high\r\n          intensity fluorescence caused an impression that the\r\n          cells were relatively empty. The thickening of dense\r\n          peripheral bands in this study was in contrast to\r\n          previous observations in endothelial cells. For example,\r\n          Zhao and Davis reported that cultured pulmonary\r\n          endothelial cells treated with H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 underwent a morphological change\r\n          that was accompanied by an accumulation/increase in\r\n          stress fibers running across the cells while the dense\r\n          peripheral bands of most cells were disrupted or\r\n          eliminated [ 38 ] . Similar observations on endothelial\r\n          cells were made by Liu and Sundqvist [ 39 ] . The dense\r\n          peripheral bands are important in cell-cell adhesion,\r\n          which maintains the structural integrity. While it is\r\n          apparent that endothelial cells used in those studies and\r\n          epithelial cells used in this study respond differently\r\n          to H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 , the underlying reason for this\r\n          difference is currently unknown. One may speculate that\r\n          RPE cells use this build-in mechanism to defend the\r\n          oxidative stress that they are constantly exposed to. We\r\n          currently have no data to support or dismiss this\r\n          possibility. In Fig. 2E, some cultures responded to H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment by a perinuclear\r\n          distribution of actin fibers. In Fig. 2F, we observed\r\n          microspikes at the periphery of the cells. A detailed\r\n          study of microspikes by Adams indicated that these\r\n          structures consist of actin, the actin binding protein,\r\n          55 kd/fascin and myosin [ 40 ] . The perinuclear staining\r\n          and microspikes of cells under oxidative stress in this\r\n          study are very similar to those observed by Huot et al.\r\n          in endothelial cells treated with H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 [ 41 ] . The functional significance\r\n          of these structural changes in RPE after H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment is not clear. There is a\r\n          possibility that the appearance of microspikes around the\r\n          cells under stressed conditions is an adapted behavior of\r\n          the cells in order to attach to the substratum firmly.\r\n          Prolonged H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment led to cell death with the\r\n          appearance of condensed nuclei is an indication of\r\n          apoptosis (Fig. 4C,4D). This general finding is\r\n          consistent with that observed by others [ 8 12 ] .\r\n          It is of interest to note that cultures with a reduced\r\n          density are more vulnerable to H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment (Fig. 1C). One\r\n          straightforward explanation for the vulnerability of\r\n          low-density cultures treated with H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 is that more molecules of H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 per cell were present in these\r\n          low-density cultures, which caused a lower viability. If\r\n          this were the case, a mathematic analysis of the H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 molecules per cell should be able to\r\n          estimate the cytotoxicity in this experimental system.\r\n          For example, 1.4 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 in a culture plated at a density of\r\n          40,000 cells/well should result in a viability close to\r\n          twice of that generated in 20,000 cells/well and four\r\n          times of that in 10,000 cells/well. Results from Fig.\r\n          1Cindicated that the viability of each condition above\r\n          was 94%, 49% or 11%, respectively. It is apparent that H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 killed more cells in cultures of\r\n          lower density (10,000 cells/well) than expected. Because\r\n          the result could not always be predicted by a mathematic\r\n          estimation, there is a possibility that cell-cell\r\n          contacts and some autocrine/paracrine production in a\r\n          culture may alter the microenvironment thus determine the\r\n          cytotoxicity caused by H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 . Since cells with lower density are\r\n          more susceptible to oxidative stress, there is a\r\n          possibility that a vicious cycle exists such that when an\r\n          area of RPE loses some of the constituent cells by\r\n          oxidative stress, the remaining cells will become even\r\n          more vulnerable to this insult.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          PPARs in RPE\r\n          This study indicated that the PPAR? agonist 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 could prevent H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 induced RPE cell death (Figs.\r\n          5A,5Band Fig. 4E). This suggests that this agent can\r\n          prevent oxidative stress induced RPE damage. This finding\r\n          is significant given prior reports that oxidative stress\r\n          on RPE is an important contributing factor of age-related\r\n          macular degeneration [ 5 42 ] . An earlier report also\r\n          indicated that PPAR? agonists could prevent laser\r\n          photocoagulation induced choroidal neovascularization in\r\n          rat eyes and monkey eyes, which suggests the possible\r\n          application of these agents on the exudative form of\r\n          age-related macular degeneration [ 43 ] . It is important\r\n          to note that the other PPAR? agonists tested in this\r\n          study (ciglitazone, azelaoyl PAF and LY171883) were\r\n          ineffective in saving cells under the same experimental\r\n          conditions. Since three out of four PPAR? agonists tested\r\n          were ineffective, this raises the possibility that the\r\n          saving effect of 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 is not through PPAR? activation. In\r\n          this respect, it should be noted that this agent has been\r\n          shown to exert some biological effects that are\r\n          independent of PPAR? activation [ 44 45 46 ] .\r\n          We have previously shown that 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 can prevent the cytotoxicity of\r\n          cholesterol oxides, end products of cholesterol under\r\n          oxidative stress [ 27 ] . Together with results from the\r\n          current study, this agent may have a general protective\r\n          effect against oxidative stress itself or against\r\n          cytotoxic agents generated by oxidative stress. It is\r\n          important to note that 15d-PGJ \r\n          2 functions as a general inhibitor of\r\n          immune activities. For example, this agent is a potent\r\n          inhibitor of microglia, the macrophage-like cells in the\r\n          central nervous system [ 47 48 49 ] and shown to be\r\n          effective in reducing the symptoms of experimental\r\n          autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for\r\n          the human disease multiple sclerosis [ 50 ] . Together,\r\n          these results suggest that this agent may be useful in\r\n          preventing ocular diseases that result from oxidative\r\n          stress or inflammation.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          ERK activation and 4-HNE protein adducts formation\r\n          as a result of oxidative stress\r\n          Oxidative stress is a potent stimulator of the MAP\r\n          kinase activities [ 14 15 51 ] . Phosphorylation of ERK\r\n          could be observed within 30-60 minutes after H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment (Fig. 6). There are\r\n          conflicting results in literature regarding whether an\r\n          increase of ERK phosphorylation is beneficial or\r\n          detrimental to cell survival. Bhat et al. demonstrated\r\n          that 5-25 ?M PD98059 could prevent H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 induced cell death in an\r\n          oligodendrocyte cell line [ 14 ] . In contrast, 20 ?M\r\n          PD98059 was shown to enhance cell death caused by H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment in HeLa cells [ 15 ] .\r\n          This reagent had no significant effect on H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treated ARPE-19 cells under our\r\n          experimental conditions. AG126, on the other hand,\r\n          appeared to reduce the cytotoxicity caused by oxidative\r\n          stress (Fig. 7). While this suggests that inhibition of\r\n          tyrosine phosphorylation or ERK activation after H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment might be beneficial for\r\n          the cells, results from PD98059 could not support this\r\n          statement.\r\n          There is a possibility that the saving effect of AG126\r\n          is not related to ERK inhibition. Under the current\r\n          experimental conditions, AG126 at 10 ?M was protective\r\n          but it enhanced H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 toxicity at 20 ?M. These results\r\n          were consistent with those reported by Sagara et al. [ 52\r\n          ] . AG126 belongs to a group of tyrosine kinase\r\n          inhibitors named tyrphostins. Many of these agents can\r\n          prevent cellular oxidative stress including that\r\n          generated by glutamate. There is no correlation between\r\n          the kinase inhibition and the observed protective effect.\r\n          Overnight treatment of cells with AG126 can increase\r\n          cellular glutathione levels. Furthermore, this agent has\r\n          some anti-oxidant effect based on the Trolox Equivalent\r\n          Activity Concentration [ 52 ] . Collectively, this may\r\n          explain the observation that AG126 at 10 ?M could\r\n          partially prevent H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 induced cytotoxicity. This agent can\r\n          also function as a mitochondria uncoupler, thus it\r\n          actually enhances H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 cytotoxicity at higher\r\n          concentrations [ 52 ] .\r\n          An accumulation of 4-HNE-conjugated protein has been\r\n          detected in lesions of aging-related diseases, including\r\n          Parkinson's disease [ 53 ] and Alzheimer's disease [ 54 ]\r\n          . It also accumulates in the affected neuronal tissues of\r\n          experimental animals experiencing brain ischemia [ 55 56\r\n          ] and traumatic spinal cord injury [ 57 ] . 4-HNE can\r\n          impair synaptosomal membrane proteins, glutamate\r\n          transport and importantly, mitochondrial functions [ 58\r\n          59 ] . Evidence indicates that 4-HNE increases neuronal\r\n          susceptibility to oxidative stress [ 60 ] and serves as a\r\n          mediator of oxidative stress that leads to neuronal\r\n          apoptosis [ 61 ] . As indicated in the Introduction,\r\n          4-HNE has been implicated in some ocular pathological\r\n          conditions [ 19 20 ] .\r\n          Several laboratories have attempted to document the\r\n          formation of 4-HNE protein adducts during oxidative\r\n          stress by Western blot analysis. Uchida et al. first\r\n          reported oxidative stress caused by t-butylhydroperoxide\r\n          or iron/ascorbate could lead to 4-HNE protein adducts in\r\n          hepatocytes [ 62 ] . Further studies by these researchers\r\n          attempted to identify the common epitope recognized by\r\n          the 4-HNE antibodies. However, no specific protein was\r\n          positively identified [ 63 ] . More recently, the\r\n          formation of 4-HNE protein adducts was also demonstrated\r\n          by Western blot analysis from the heart [ 64 ] , the\r\n          liver [ 65 ] and the kidney [ 66 ] under oxidative\r\n          stress. It is important to point out that the patterns of\r\n          4-HNE protein adducts, as shown by these Western blot\r\n          analyses, were different among these studies, probably as\r\n          a result of tissue specificity. No particular protein was\r\n          identified as a specific target for 4-HNE adduct\r\n          formation in these studies. Results from the current\r\n          study indicate that H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment of RPE could lead to the\r\n          accumulation of 4-HNE protein adducts in the cytoplasm\r\n          and the nuclei of these cells (Fig. 3). There was a\r\n          dose-dependent increase of 4-HNE protein adduct after H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 treatment with a maximal intensity\r\n          of ~7X control at 2 mM H \r\n          2 O \r\n          2 (Fig. 3C). This may partially\r\n          contribute to oxidative stress induced ocular disease.\r\n          Even though ocular tissues, including the retina, contain\r\n          glutathione S-transferases that can actively detoxify\r\n          4-HNE [ 35 67 ] , adverse events may occur if aging or\r\n          pathological conditions hinder this normal defense from\r\n          functioning properly. It warrants further studies to\r\n          identify those proteins species that are modified by\r\n          4-HNE.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Conclusions\r\n        This study demonstrates that oxidative stress induced by\r\n        H \r\n        2 O \r\n        2 could lead to RPE cell death, which is\r\n        preceded by distinct morphological changes, ERK activation\r\n        and 4-HNE protein adduct formation. The cell death can be\r\n        prevented partially by AG126, and the prostaglandin\r\n        derivative, 15d-PGJ \r\n        2. These agents may be useful\r\n        pharmacological tools in the future capable of preventing\r\n        oxidative stress induced RPE cell death in human ocular\r\n        diseases.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Competing Interests\r\n        None declared.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Authors' Contributions\r\n        TKG and JYC were both involved in the experimental\r\n        design and data collection.
