The intent of\r\n        these devices is to thermally necrose tissue by raising\r\n        targeted tissue temperatures to approximately 100?C for a\r\n        period of 10-15 minutes [ 1 2 ] . Ablation probes are\r\n        inserted percutaneously or subdermally into tissues where\r\n        cancerous tumors have been identified. Once the probes are\r\n        positioned, radiofrequency energy is delivered through the\r\n        probe, into surrounding tissue, and to an electrical ground\r\n        pad that is applied to the skin of the patient.\r\n        As a technique, the use of radiofrequency energy in\r\n        ablation procedures has been well established. However, its\r\n        use in treating tumors in soft organs, such as the liver,\r\n        presents some new constraints that were not common to its\r\n        previous uses. In cardiac ablation, for example, the goal\r\n        of the ablation procedure is to eradicate the tissue\r\n        pathology needed to sustain an arrhythmia, or abnormal\r\n        heart rhythm [ 3 4 ] . By monitoring changes in shape of\r\n        the electrograms, physicians can determine when procedures\r\n        are complete. In contrast, the absence of a natural\r\n        real-time feedback parameter in hepatic tumor ablation\r\n        makes it difficult to assess completion of an ablation\r\n        procedure. A surrogate endpoint is the necrosis of a tissue\r\n        area much larger than the size of the tumor to insure that\r\n        all cancerous cells within the volume are eradicated [ 5 ]\r\n        . To achieve this endpoint requires a good understanding of\r\n        the mechanism of ablation. Our present understanding of\r\n        ablation is mainly derived from experiences with other\r\n        medical devices such as hyperthermia and electrosurgical\r\n        units [ 6 7 8 ] , which function differently than\r\n        radiofrequency ablation devices.\r\n        The intent of microwave hyperthermia devices (operating\r\n        at 27 MHz or 2.45 GHz) is to raise the temperature of\r\n        tumorous tissues to between 43-45?C for extended periods of\r\n        time on the order of hours [ 9 ] . Microwave hyperthermia\r\n        devices deliver energy at low doses of energy over long\r\n        periods of time; whereas, radiofrequency ablation devices\r\n        deliver high doses of energy for short periods of time [ 10\r\n        ] . Microwave hyperthermia devices and radiofrequency\r\n        ablation devices differ in other important ways. The\r\n        dielectric properties of hepatic tissue in the microwave\r\n        frequency range differ greatly from those at\r\n        radiofrequencies, resulting in a substantially different\r\n        depth of penetration of energy. At 500 kHz, liver\r\n        conductivity is approximately 0.148 S/m. By comparison,\r\n        liver conductivity at 27 MHz and 2.45 GHz are 0.382 and\r\n        1.687 S/m, respectively [ 11 ] . As a result, for\r\n        comparable source strengths, current disperses more readily\r\n        into tissue at higher frequencies. Thus, at higher\r\n        frequencies, heating patterns are more spread out and tend\r\n        to deliver lesser heating than at lower frequencies.\r\n        Another important difference between microwave hyperthermia\r\n        devices and hepatic radiofrequency ablation devices is the\r\n        mode of energy transfer. At microwave frequencies, energy\r\n        is primarily transferred to tissue via capacitive coupling\r\n        (field heating) which causes vibration of particles in\r\n        tissues, resulting in tissue heating. At frequencies used\r\n        by radiofrequency ablation devices, energy is transferred\r\n        primarily by conductive (ohmic) heating, where current is\r\n        generated through the movement of charge from the ablation\r\n        probe to the electrical ground plate via the path of least\r\n        resistance.\r\n        In electrosurgical devices, high bursts of energy are\r\n        used for short periods of time to achieve cutting and\r\n        coagulative effects on tissues [ 12 13 14 ] .\r\n        Electrosurgical devices and radiofrequency ablation probes\r\n        both operate within the same frequency range and transfer\r\n        energy in similar ways, but differ in the shape of\r\n        stimulation waveforms. Radiofrequency ablation devices\r\n        utilize a continuous sinusoidal waveform. Electrosurgical\r\n        devices use variable waveform shape and duty cycle duration\r\n        to achieve fulguration, cutting, or desiccation [ 15 16 ] .\r\n        In general the application of energy with electrosurgical\r\n        devices is intense for an extremely short period of time\r\n        (several seconds). Thus, the temperatures achieved by\r\n        electrosurgical units do not penetrate as deeply into\r\n        tissue as radiofrequency ablation devices.\r\n        In recent years, the use of computational models for\r\n        radiofrequency ablation has risen as a means of studying\r\n        the dosiometric and heat transfer profiles surrounding the\r\n        ablation probes. Data from these models, however, have\r\n        varied considerably from experimental measurement [ 17 18 ]\r\n        . There are several contributing factors for these\r\n        variations: metabolism, blood flow, tissue perfusion, and\r\n        motion. One additional explanation for inaccuracies in\r\n        these models is the use of constant electrical properties\r\n        of tissues in modeling. There are no known studies to date\r\n        that specifically study the effects of temperature\r\n        dependent electrical properties on the dosimetric and heat\r\n        transfer profiles surrounding ablation probes [ 19 20 ] .\r\n        Perhaps the greatest reason for assuming constant\r\n        electrical properties is the enormous computational\r\n        advantage of being able to separate the electromagnetic and\r\n        heat transfer problems. By separating the two problems,\r\n        computational resources can be reduced significantly by\r\n        sequentially solving the electric field and temperature\r\n        distribution. A constant electrical conductivity\r\n        necessitates a constant electric field and current density\r\n        and, thus, imposes a one-way coupling between the\r\n        electrical and thermal problems. More specifically, the\r\n        thermal calculation is dependent on the calculation of the\r\n        electric field, whereas, the electrical field is\r\n        independent of the thermal profile.\r\n        Several investigators have shown that the electrical\r\n        conductivity of materials is temperature-dependent [ 21 ] .\r\n        The magnitude of this effect is also material and frequency\r\n        dependent. When temperature-dependent electrical\r\n        conductivity is applied to computational models,\r\n        bi-directional coupling is imposed between electrical and\r\n        thermal problems. Thus, the thermal profile and the\r\n        electric field are interdependent. The purpose of this\r\n        study is to determine to what extent simplification of\r\n        constant electrical properties can be used and to determine\r\n        the amount of error that results when temperature-dependent\r\n        effects are ignored.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Methods\r\n        \r\n          Temperature-Dependent Conductivity\r\n          Since, to date, there have been no formal experimental\r\n          measurements on the temperature-dependence of the\r\n          electrical conductivity of liver, we have assumed that\r\n          the temperature-dependent behavior of liver tissue is\r\n          similar to that of an equivalent sodium chloride\r\n          solution. Stogryn [ 23 ] derived expressions for the\r\n          conductivity (?) of sodium chloride solutions at given\r\n          the temperature (T) and normality ( \r\n          N ):\r\n          ? (T, \r\n          N ) = ? (25, \r\n          N ) {1.000-1.962 ? 10 -2? + 8.08 ?\r\n          10 -5? 2\r\n          - \r\n          N ? [3.020 ? 10 -5+ 3.922 ? 10 -5?\r\n          + \r\n          N (1.721 ? 10 -5?\r\n          - 6.584 ? 10 -6?)]} (Eq.1)\r\n          where\r\n          ? (25, \r\n          N ) = \r\n          N [10.394-2.3776 \r\n          N +0.68258 \r\n          N 2- 9.13538 \r\n          N 3+ 1.0086 ? 10 -2 \r\n          N 4]\r\n          and ? = 25-T. Using this established relationship, we\r\n          chose a NaCl concentration that produced an equivalent\r\n          electrical conductivity of liver tissues at 37?C\r\n          (approximately 0.134 S/m). The rationale for using NaCl\r\n          solutions stems from several known phenomena. First,\r\n          liver tissue has high water content. As a first-order\r\n          approximation, liver can be modeled as compartmental\r\n          areas containing salt solutions. Second, it has been\r\n          reported that at low frequencies, the electrical\r\n          properties of tissue are dominated mainly by the\r\n          electrical conductivity [ 24 ] . The electrical\r\n          permittivity, which is more closely related to the\r\n          cellular structure of cells, is a much smaller component\r\n          to tissue impedance than the electrical conductivity and\r\n          can be ignored in a first-order calculation.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions\r\n          Radiofrequency ablation probes operate between 460-550\r\n          kHz. At these frequencies, the wavelength is several\r\n          orders of magnitude larger than the size of the ablation\r\n          electrode. Thus, the ablation probe dissipates the\r\n          majority of its energy through electrical conduction and\r\n          not capacitive coupling. In this situation, we assumed a\r\n          quasi-static electrical conduction model, which allows us\r\n          to solve the electric field by using Laplace's\r\n          equation\r\n          ??[?( \r\n          T )? \r\n          V ] = 0 (Eq.2)\r\n          where ? is the gradient operator (?? = ??/? x + ??/? y\r\n          + ??/? z), ? (T) is the temperature-dependent\r\n          conductivity (Siemens/meter), and V is the electric\r\n          potential (Volts).\r\n          Heat transfer in tissue is governed by the heat\r\n          conduction equation\r\n          \r\n          where ? is the density (kg/m 3), \r\n          c is the heat capacity (J/kg-K), \r\n          k is the heat conduction coefficient\r\n          (W/K-m), ? \r\n          b is the density of blood, C \r\n          b is the heat capacity of blood, ? is\r\n          the blood perfusion coefficient, T \r\n          amb is the ambient temperature, and Q \r\n          m is the metabolic heat source term.\r\n          For all cases, we assumed that the metabolic heat source\r\n          was insignificant. In the cases where blood perfusion\r\n          were ignored, ? = 0. Since our main interest is to\r\n          simulate the highest temperatures achieved during\r\n          radiofrequency ablation, we considered only the steady\r\n          state problem.\r\n          The difference in the methodology used to solve these\r\n          governing equations for the cases of constant and\r\n          temperature-dependent conductivity stems from the method\r\n          in which Laplace's equation (Equation 2) is solved. In\r\n          the case where the electrical conductivity is a constant,\r\n          Laplace's equation can be rearranged such that ?? 2V = 0.\r\n          Since the rearranged expression is not a function of\r\n          temperature, it can be solved independently of the heat\r\n          conduction equation (Equation 3). The expression for the\r\n          electric potential (V) can be solved quickly over the\r\n          entire volume and the solution can be implemented into\r\n          the source term of the heat conduction equation. Since\r\n          temperature is a function of position and is not uniform\r\n          over the volume, the electrical conductivity is a\r\n          function of both temperature and position in the case of\r\n          temperature-dependence. In this situation, Equations 2\r\n          and 3 must be simultaneously solved which involves\r\n          iterative computation of both the electrical conductivity\r\n          and the temperature.\r\n          In both the temperature-dependent conductivity and\r\n          constant conductivity models, the boundary conditions\r\n          were the same. For each of the outer surfaces of the\r\n          model, an electrical boundary condition of V = 0 was\r\n          applied, to simulate the return ground electrode. A\r\n          source potential (V \r\n          o ) was applied to the conducting\r\n          areas of the probe. The non-conducting portions were\r\n          given an insulating boundary condition such that \r\n          n ?(??V) = 0; where \r\n          n is the unit vector normal to the\r\n          surface, ? is the electrical conductivity, and V is the\r\n          voltage at the insulating surface. The thermal boundary\r\n          conditions for the surface of the box were T = T \r\n          amb . Since the thermal mass of the\r\n          probe was small compared to the surrounding saline, we\r\n          assumed that heat conduction into the probe itself was\r\n          minimal. Thus, for all other surfaces, the thermally\r\n          insulating boundary condition \r\n          n ?(k?T) = 0 was applied.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Solver Method\r\n          Four finite element models were compared: constant\r\n          electrical conductivity without tissue perfusion,\r\n          temperature-dependent conductivity without tissue\r\n          perfusion, constant electrical conductivity with tissue\r\n          perfusion, and temperature-dependent conductivity with\r\n          tissue perfusion.\r\n          To solve these models, we used an iterative finite\r\n          element multigrid solver with an initial coarse grid of\r\n          8,787 nodes and 42,045 elements. Nineteen (19) cycles\r\n          were necessary to converge the solution resulting in a\r\n          fine grid of 34,452 nodes and 178,389 elements. For each\r\n          run, the electric field (E), the current density (J), the\r\n          heat flux (HF), and the resulting temperature (T) were\r\n          calculated. The electrical conductivity (? = J/E) and the\r\n          specific absorption rate (SAR = J?E) were also\r\n          calculated. Simulations were made for each of the four\r\n          models with source voltages of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5,\r\n          15, 17.5, and 20 volts. Additional simulations were made\r\n          at 22.5, 25.0, and 27.5 volts for the two models with\r\n          tissue perfusion to attain simulation data near 100?C.\r\n          All of these calculations were implemented using FEMLAB\r\n          (Comsol, Burlington MA, USA) on a 1.8 GHz Intel Pentium\r\n          IV, with 1 Gbyte RAM.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Results\r\n        For each of the voltage settings, the maximum electric\r\n        field, current density, temperature, heat flux,\r\n        conductivity and SAR were recorded for the cases with no\r\n        tissue perfusion (Table 2) and with tissue perfusion (Table\r\n        3).\r\n        Figure 3shows a comparison of the maximum electric field\r\n        strengths computed for the four models when a source\r\n        voltage of 20.0 volts is applied. In each case, the\r\n        electric field is shown to be non-uniform, favoring the\r\n        proximal edge and the distal tip of the ablation probe. The\r\n        maximum electric field occurs at the proximal edge. In the\r\n        results from the two models that assume constant electrical\r\n        conductivity, the maximum electric field is the same. The\r\n        models that assume a temperature-dependent electrical\r\n        conductivity have an electric field strength that is\r\n        approximately 3% less. Figure 4shows a plot of the maximum\r\n        electric field strength plotted as a function of source\r\n        voltage. For the cases that use constant conductivity, the\r\n        electric field is directly proportional to the magnitude of\r\n        the source. As the source voltage increases, the\r\n        differences between the model results of the constant\r\n        conductivity and temperature-dependent conductivity models\r\n        increase. The nonlinearity in the results for\r\n        temperature-dependent conductivity arise from solving\r\n        Laplace's equation using the more general expression\r\n        ??[?(T)?V] = 0. Tables 4and 5demonstrate that the changes\r\n        in the electric field are not related to tissue perfusion.\r\n        A plot of the electric field strength along the surface of\r\n        the ablation probe (Figure 5) shows that in all four\r\n        models, the resulting distribution of the electric field is\r\n        nearly the same.\r\n        Figure 6shows a comparison of the maximum current\r\n        density computed for the four models when 20.0 volts is\r\n        applied. In the cases where the electrical conductivity is\r\n        constant, the current density is a linear scaling of the\r\n        electric field and is the same with and without tissue\r\n        perfusion. For the case where temperature-dependent\r\n        conductivity is applied in the absence of tissue perfusion,\r\n        the current density increases 120%. When perfusion is added\r\n        to the temperature-dependent conductivity model, the\r\n        current density increases approximately 53%. These data\r\n        indicate that current density is explicitly related to\r\n        temperature-dependent phenomena and implicitly related to\r\n        tissue perfusion. Therefore, any changes in the current\r\n        density due to perfusion are only observable if\r\n        temperature-dependent electrical conductivity is accounted\r\n        for in computational models. Figures 7and 8demonstrate that\r\n        in both of the cases with (green) and without (red) tissue\r\n        perfusion which utilize constant electrical conductivity,\r\n        the current density distribution is the same. The figures\r\n        also indicate that adding temperature-dependent and\r\n        perfusion phenomena produce substantially different\r\n        results.\r\n        A major consequence of accounting for\r\n        temperature-dependent phenomena is the large change in the\r\n        electrical conductivity. Figures 9and 10show that the\r\n        electrical conductivity change considerably when\r\n        temperature-dependence is accounted for (128% without\r\n        perfusion, 60% with perfusion). As seen in the results for\r\n        current density, the electrical conductivity is explicitly\r\n        related to temperature-dependent phenomena and implicitly\r\n        related to tissue perfusion. Figure 11shows the\r\n        distribution of temperature-dependent electrical\r\n        conductivity along the surface of the ablation probe. For\r\n        the case where tissue perfusion is neglected, the center of\r\n        the ablation probe is the area with the largest\r\n        conductivity change. When tissue perfusion is accounted\r\n        for, the areas corresponding to the proximal edge and the\r\n        distal tip experience the most change. Figure 12shows a\r\n        three-dimensional representation of the\r\n        temperature-dependent conductivity change with no\r\n        perfusion. The figure shows a rapid decrease in the\r\n        conductivity change in the radial direction.\r\n        The changes in the electric field, current density, and\r\n        electrical conductivity contribute to changes in the\r\n        specific absorption rate (SAR). The SAR is the mass\r\n        normalized rate of electromagnetic energy deposited into\r\n        tissue. Figures 13and 14show changes in the SAR that\r\n        closely resemble the changes in the electrical conductivity\r\n        and current density. These figures indicate that\r\n        temperature-dependent phenomena dominate the changes that\r\n        occur in modeling results using electromagnetic heat\r\n        sources.\r\n        Figure 15presents a comparison of the heat flux for the\r\n        four models when a source voltage of 20.0 volts is applied.\r\n        In each case, the heat flux is greatest at the proximal\r\n        edge and the distal tip of the ablation probe. The data\r\n        show that accounting for perfusion decreases the heat flux\r\n        by 4%. Accounting for temperature-dependent electrical\r\n        conductivity increases the heat flux by approximately 11%.\r\n        This demonstrates that temperature-dependent phenomena\r\n        dominate the changes that occur in the heat sink (Figure\r\n        16).\r\n        Figure 17shows a comparison of the temperature\r\n        distribution computed for the four models using a source\r\n        voltage of 20.0 volts. This figure clearly indicates that\r\n        the resulting temperature is dominated by tissue perfusion.\r\n        At temperatures near 100?C, we see differences of\r\n        approximately 5% between models that include and exclude\r\n        tissue perfusion. Figure 18shows the maximum temperatures\r\n        achieved using the four models as a function of source\r\n        voltage. By increasing the source voltage to 27.5 volts in\r\n        the models with tissue perfusion, we were able to achieve\r\n        temperatures near 100?C. Tables 3and 5show that the\r\n        resulting temperature differences near 100?C are\r\n        approximately 8%. These data suggest that the amount of\r\n        error incurred by neglecting temperature-dependent\r\n        phenomena is not related to the level of tissue perfusion,\r\n        but is more closely related to temperature. Figure 19shows\r\n        that in the absence of tissue perfusion, the highest\r\n        temperatures are achieved in the center of the ablation\r\n        probe. When tissue perfusion is accounted for, the highest\r\n        temperatures occur at the proximal edge and the distal tip.\r\n        Thus, the distribution of temperature is more strongly\r\n        related to the presence of tissue perfusion.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Discussion and Conclusions\r\n        \r\n          Model Limitations\r\n          There are several important differences between the\r\n          temperature dependent properties of NaCl solutions and\r\n          those of tissue. First, temperature elevation of tissue\r\n          results in the denaturing of proteins, which changes the\r\n          electrical conductivity of tissue in a highly nonlinear\r\n          fashion. While the exact effect of protein denaturing is\r\n          not well understood, it is evident that the resulting\r\n          conductivity does not change linearly with temperature,\r\n          as in sodium chloride solutions. Preliminary data suggest\r\n          that the electrical conductivity of tissues change\r\n          substantially once tissue is damaged. This phenomena has\r\n          been well established \r\n          in vitro and \r\n          in vivo [ 3 25 ] . Thus, the\r\n          effects of temperature-dependent changes are likely to be\r\n          understated.\r\n          A second limitation in our model is that it does not\r\n          account for changes in tissue conductivity by assessing\r\n          tissue damage. Several investigators have suggested that\r\n          tissue follows an Arrhenius function [ 26 ] . As such,\r\n          tissue damage is a function of temperature and time. A\r\n          subtlety in modeling ablation problems is that plots of\r\n          temperature distribution do not necessarily equate to\r\n          plots of resulting lesion size. This is especially true\r\n          if ablations are performed for relatively finite periods\r\n          of time. In our study, we have restricted our models to\r\n          examining the steady-state changes in the various thermal\r\n          and electromagnetic parameters. By doing so, tissue\r\n          reaching a threshold temperature is assumed to be\r\n          uniformly damaged. Therefore, for purposes of this study,\r\n          temperature distribution and lesion size are equivalent\r\n          and the Arrhenius phenomena are non-existent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n
