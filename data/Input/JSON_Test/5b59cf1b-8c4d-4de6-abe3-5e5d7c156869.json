It plays a pivotal role in the\r\n        inflammatory cascade and, together with IL-1 and IL-6, has\r\n        been shown to mediate the acute-phase response [ 5 6 ] .\r\n        Confirmation of its significance in disease comes from the\r\n        success of clinical trials using anti-TNF therapy to treat\r\n        rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease [ 7 8 9 10 ] .\r\n        Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or endotoxin, is\r\n        found only in Gram-negative bacterial cell walls; it can on\r\n        its own induce the acute inflammatory response and the\r\n        clinical characteristics associated with sepsis. After\r\n        administration of LPS, TNF and other inflammatory mediators\r\n        are released [ 11 12 ] . Infusion of TNF initiates an\r\n        inflammatory process leading to a phenotype that is\r\n        indistinguishable from bacterial sepsis [ 13 14 ] .\r\n        Recent work on tristetraprolin (TTP) has provided a new\r\n        perspective on the regulation of TNF biosynthesis. TTP\r\n        (also referred to as NuP475, TIS11, or GOS24) is a member\r\n        of the family of zinc-finger proteins that was originally\r\n        identified through genetic screens designed to identify\r\n        immediate early response genes [ 15 16 17 18 ] . TTP was\r\n        shown to be an unusually proline-rich protein with a\r\n        predicted molecular weight of 33.6 kDa. Its name derives\r\n        from the presence of three PPPPG amino acid repeats that\r\n        are conserved across species. There are two Cys-Cys-Cys-His\r\n        (CCCH) zinc fingers, which are responsible for RNA binding\r\n        [ 17 19 ] . There are no studies of the subcellular\r\n        localization or the regulation of expression of native TTP\r\n        in freshly isolated cells or tissue. Transfection studies\r\n        using nonhematopoietic cell lines or prolonged cell culture\r\n        have suggested that TTP is found in both cytoplasm and the\r\n        nucleus [ 20 21 22 23 24 ] .\r\n        A deficiency of TTP is associated with a profound\r\n        proinflammatory phenotype. TTP-deficient mice exhibit\r\n        cachexia, with dermatitis, medullary and extramedullary\r\n        hyperplasia, erosive polyarthritis, and autoimmunity with\r\n        autoantibodies [ 25 ] . This phenotype is similar to that\r\n        observed in mice that overexpress TNF [ 26 ] . In agreement\r\n        with these data, TTP-deficient mice were shown to\r\n        overproduce TNF, and weekly injections of a neutralizing\r\n        antibody to TNF eliminated the predominant features of this\r\n        phenotype. In addition, mice with the double deletion of\r\n        TTP and TNF receptor (TNFR)-1 do not manifest the\r\n        aggressive inflammation observed in TTP-deficient mice. In\r\n        contrast, mice deficient in TTP and TNFR-2 show a more\r\n        severe phenotype, suggesting a protective role for this\r\n        receptor [ 27 ] .\r\n        The increase in TNF biosynthesis in TTP-deficient mice\r\n        is associated with increased mRNA stability [ 23 ] . TTP\r\n        binds to the AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3' untranslated\r\n        region of TNF mRNA, which regulates TNF mRNA turnover \r\n        in vivo [ 28 ] . The interaction\r\n        between TTP/TNF and the ARE promotes the turnover of TNF\r\n        mRNA. TTP also regulates the stability of GM-CSF\r\n        (granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor) mRNA\r\n        through the ARE, and therefore TTP deficiency is associated\r\n        with increased production of GM-CSF and with myeloid\r\n        hyperplasia. This is not a TNF-dependent effect, since the\r\n        phenotype is not affected by the removal of either TNFR-1\r\n        or -2 or by the addition of TNF antibody [ 27 ] . Recent\r\n        studies have suggested a potential interaction between TTP\r\n        and both IL-3 and IL-8 via the ARE in their mRNA [ 29 30 ]\r\n        .\r\n        All studies of TTP expression to date have relied on\r\n        transfected cells and cell lines; there have been no\r\n        studies on the localization of expression of human TTP, or\r\n        on its regulation \r\n        in vivo or in freshly isolated normal\r\n        cells. To examine the kinetic relation between TNF\r\n        production and TTP expression in models of septic shock, we\r\n        developed an intracellular flow cytometric assay. By this\r\n        method, expression of TTP was determined in peripheral\r\n        blood leukocytes after the response to \r\n        in vitro stimulation with LPS. TTP\r\n        was initially upregulated in all the cells in response to\r\n        LPS, as shown by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.\r\n        The contribution of TNF to this LPS-induced upregulation\r\n        was confirmed using a humanized monoclonal antibody to TNF.\r\n        The kinetics of TTP production was also examined in four\r\n        individuals infused with LPS. After \r\n        in vivo exposure to LPS, the initial\r\n        rise in TTP expression correlated with the plasma TNF\r\n        level. We also observed secondary increases in some\r\n        individuals, without parallel increments in TNF. These\r\n        observations suggest that there are multiple factors\r\n        involved in the regulation of TTP.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Materials and methods\r\n        \r\n          Generation of antihuman TTP polyclonal\r\n          antibody\r\n          A peptide corresponding to the C terminus (amino acids\r\n          302-328) of human TTP was synthesized, purified by HPLC,\r\n          and coupled to KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin;\r\n          Macromolecular Resources, Fort Collins, CO, USA).\r\n          Anti-human TTP polyclonal antibody was generated by\r\n          immunization of New Zealand white rabbits with the\r\n          KLH-coupled TTP C-terminal peptide (GeneMed, San\r\n          Francisco, CA, USA). The rabbit antiserum obtained was\r\n          affinity-purified by passage over a Sulfolink column\r\n          (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) to which disulfide linkage of\r\n          the peptide had been used to immobilize the peptide.\r\n          Specificity in Western blotting and flow cytometry was\r\n          evaluated by detection of exogenous TTP in transfected\r\n          293 cells and by blocking this activity with peptide [ 24\r\n          ] .\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Generation of TTP vector constructs\r\n          Human TTP cDNA was generated by RT-PCR from THP-1 RNA\r\n          and cloned into the pcDNA 3.1His-C vector (Invitrogen,\r\n          Carlsbad, CA, USA), which encodes a histidine and epitope\r\n          (EXPRESS-TAG) at the N-terminus of the protein.\r\n          Orientation of the cloned DNA and the integrity of the\r\n          DNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing with the ABI\r\n          Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PerkinElmer,\r\n          Wellesley, MA, USA), and searched against the published\r\n          sequence (TTP accession no. M63625) on the NCBI Database\r\n          using the BLAST search program.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Transient transfection\r\n          Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA,\r\n          USA) were plated at a density of 160,000 cells per cm 2in\r\n          6-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA). TTP (1 ?g) or\r\n          the TTP parental vector pcDNA3.1 His-C (control) was\r\n          mixed with 50 ?l of serum-free RPMI (Roswell Park\r\n          Memorial Institute) medium. The DNA was mixed with 2 ?l\r\n          of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies,\r\n          Rockville, MD, USA) in a total volume of 50 ?l of\r\n          serum-free RPMI per cm 2of cells, incubated for 3 hours,\r\n          and followed by the addition of an equal volume of media\r\n          containing 20% fetal calf serum.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Cell preparation\r\n          THP-1 (generously provided by Dr P Guyre, Dartmouth\r\n          Medical School), Jurkat (ATCC), and 293 cell lines were\r\n          cultured in RPMI complete medium (CM), consisting of RPMI\r\n          1640 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 ml\r\n          of sodium pyruvate, 2.0 mmol/l of L-glutamine, 25 mmol/l\r\n          of 1 M HEPES\r\n          (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid),\r\n          0.1 mmol/l of nonessential amino acids, 0.25 ?g/ml of\r\n          amphotericin, 50 ?g/ml gentamicin (all from BioWhittaker,\r\n          Walkersville, MD, USA) and 5 ? 10 -5M 2-mercaptoethanol\r\n          (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Transfected and\r\n          nontransfected 293 cells were harvested using trypsin\r\n          (Life Technologies), washed twice with CM, resuspended to\r\n          a concentration of 5 ? 10 6cells/ml, and fixed with 4%\r\n          methanol-free formaldehyde (Polysciences Inc, Warrington,\r\n          PA, USA). THP-1 cells were incubated with and without\r\n          LPS, 0.1 ?g/ml ( \r\n          Escherichia coli 055:B5, Sigma), or\r\n          with and without TNF (100 U/ml). In addition, infliximab\r\n          (Remicade ?), 100 ?g/ml (Centocor Inc, Malvern,\r\n          Pennsylvania, USA), was also incubated with and without\r\n          LPS or TNF to determine how much effect TNF has on TTP\r\n          induction. Preliminary studies on TNF-induced I?B?\r\n          phosphorylation determined the optimum concentration for\r\n          inhibition with infliximab. After incubation, the cells\r\n          were washed in staining buffer and fixed with 1%\r\n          formaldehyde.\r\n          Leukocytes from healthy donors were isolated by\r\n          dextran sedimentation from heparinized peripheral blood.\r\n          In some experiments, blood was combined 1:1 with RPMI CM\r\n          and incubated with or without 0.1 ?g/ml LPS. At the\r\n          indicated times, blood was mixed 1:1 with 2% dextran (150\r\n          kDa; Polysciences) in prewarmed RPMI and left at 37?C for\r\n          20 min to sediment the red blood cells preferentially.\r\n          The white-cell supernatant was then aspirated,\r\n          centrifuged, and mixed 1:5 with CM. After centrifugation,\r\n          the cell pellet was resuspended with staining buffer\r\n          (prechilled to 4?C) consisting of phosphate-buffered\r\n          saline solution with 0.2% BSA and 1 ?g/ml sodium azide.\r\n          The white cells were then counted using Turks solution\r\n          (0.01% crystal violet and 3% acetic acid in distilled\r\n          water), washed as before, and resuspended to a\r\n          concentration of 5 ? 10 6cells/ml with staining\r\n          buffer.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Immunofluorescence staining\r\n          To detect extracellular antigens, cells were pipetted\r\n          into a 96-well polypropylene plate (Costar), and the\r\n          plate was centrifuged at 400 \r\n          \r\n            g \r\n           for 5 min. The cells and reagents were kept at 4?C\r\n          for the remainder of the experiment. The supernatant was\r\n          aspirated, and the cells were resuspended in 6% human IgG\r\n          (Sigma) in staining buffer to block nonspecific binding.\r\n          Allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated CD14 (Becton, Dickinson\r\n          and Co, San Jose, CA, USA) was added, and the cells were\r\n          incubated for a further 20 min in the dark. The cells\r\n          were then washed once in staining buffer and residual red\r\n          blood cells lysed with FACS' Lysing solution (Becton\r\n          Dickinson). After 5 min the cells were washed twice with\r\n          staining buffer and fixed overnight in 1%\r\n          formaldehyde.\r\n          To detect intracellular TTP, fixed cells were washed\r\n          twice in permeabilization buffer (consisting of staining\r\n          buffer with the addition of 1 ?g/ml saponin), centrifuged\r\n          as before, and incubated for 30 min at 4?C in blocking\r\n          buffer, consisting of 3% IgG with 3% nonfat powdered milk\r\n          for leukocytes in permeabilization buffer. The plate was\r\n          centrifuged, the supernatant was aspirated, and 3.8 ?g\r\n          per 5 ? 10 5cells of anti-TTP rabbit polyclonal or\r\n          control antibody (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) was added\r\n          for 45 min more. After incubation, the cells were washed\r\n          in permeabilization buffer and resuspended in\r\n          FITC-conjugated F(ab') \r\n          2 (antigen-binding fragment) donkey\r\n          antirabbit IgG (25 ?g/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West\r\n          Grove, PA, USA) for 45 min at 4?C. Cells were washed with\r\n          permeabilization buffer and then with staining buffer.\r\n          They were resuspended with 1% formaldehyde and stored in\r\n          the dark at 4?C until analysis. For the infliximab\r\n          inhibition experiments, a goat polyclonal antibody to TTP\r\n          was used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA)\r\n          with a secondary swine antigoat FITC-conjugated IgG\r\n          antibody (Sigma). Preliminary experiments showed that the\r\n          affinity of this antibody for TTP was equivalent to that\r\n          of the rabbit polyclonal antibody.\r\n          In the LPS infusion study, TruCount ?calibration beads\r\n          (Becton Dickinson) were quantitatively added to the\r\n          stained cells. Enumeration of individual leukocyte counts\r\n          was then completed using Cell Quest ?software.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          FACS analysis and confocal microscopy\r\n          Analysis by flow cytometry was completed using a\r\n          FAC-SCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Contaminants, such as\r\n          red cells and cell debris, were removed by forward and\r\n          side scatter gating; in addition, CD14 versus side\r\n          scatter was used to create gates to differentiate\r\n          lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. Fluorescein\r\n          fluorescence was detected through the FL-1 channel, APC\r\n          fluorescence was assessed using the FL-4 channel, and\r\n          data were acquired and analyzed using the CellQuest\r\n          ?application on a Power Macintosh G3 computer. For each\r\n          sample, at least 2000 monocytes were collected and the\r\n          mean fluorescence intensity was evaluated. Calibration\r\n          was done using Rainbow Microspheres (Spherotech Inc,\r\n          Libertyville, IL, USA), with final values expressed as\r\n          the milliequivalents of soluble fluorescein (MESF) [ 31 ]\r\n          .\r\n          293 cells were sorted for the brightest FITC\r\n          fluorescence using a FACStar Plus flow cytometer (Becton\r\n          Dickinson). Cells were collected into tubes containing\r\n          100 ?l fetal calf serum, centrifuged, and resuspended in\r\n          1% formaldehyde. The cells were stored overnight at 4?C\r\n          in the dark. TTP/FITC-stained white blood cells or THP-1\r\n          cells were centrifuged and resuspended in formaldehyde as\r\n          for 293 cells. Nuclear staining was done using propidium\r\n          iodide 0.01 mg/ml (Sigma). For confocal microscopy, cells\r\n          were pipetted from the base of the settled cell\r\n          suspension and placed onto a glass slide with Prolong\r\n          ?Antifade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) to inhibit\r\n          quenching. The cells were then covered with a cover slip\r\n          protected with clear nail polish.\r\n          Microscopy for FITC-conjugated TTP analysis was\r\n          completed using a BioRad MRC1024 laser scanning confocal\r\n          microscope (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Cells were\r\n          scanned for fluorescence using the 488-nm line from a\r\n          15-mW Kr/Ar laser and two photodetectors (522/32-nm\r\n          dichroic for FITC fluorescence and 585-nm longpass for\r\n          propidium iodide fluorescence). A 63? Plan-APO 1.4 NA\r\n          objective (Carl Zeiss Inc, Thornwood, NY, USA) was used\r\n          in conjunction with an iris setting of 2.5, which allowed\r\n          for detection of optical sections of the fluorescence\r\n          image that were approximately 0.5 ?m thick.\r\n          Representative images were selected from the slices\r\n          though the center of the cells after sectioning through\r\n          the entire cell.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          LPS infusion\r\n          Consenting volunteers were given an intravenous bolus\r\n          of endotoxin in accordance with a protocol approved by\r\n          the Institutional and Scientific Review Boards of the\r\n          Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Norris Cotton\r\n          Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH, USA. One month before\r\n          admission and again just before admission, the\r\n          volunteers' physical wellbeing and health were assessed,\r\n          and current medications were noted. The infusion was\r\n          conducted in the intensive care unit at\r\n          Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center with continuous\r\n          supervision for the first 12 hours. Blood pressure, heart\r\n          rate, and body temperature were evaluated throughout this\r\n          period.\r\n          Clinical Center reference endotoxin (CCRE), lot O:133,\r\n          derived from \r\n          E. coli (United States Pharmacopeia\r\n          Convention Inc, Rockville, MD, USA [ 32 ] ), was injected\r\n          intravenously at a dose of 4 ng/kg. Three consecutive\r\n          baseline blood samples were taken, at 15, 10, and 5 min\r\n          before infusion, and samples were taken at 0.45, 1, 2, 4,\r\n          8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after infusion, from a\r\n          peripheral, indwelling, venous catheter directly into a\r\n          heparinized syringe (Becton Dickinson). Blood was\r\n          sedimented in dextran, extracellularly stained for CD14,\r\n          and fixed with 1% formaldehyde. The cells were stored\r\n          overnight at 4?C and then stained for intracellular TTP.\r\n          A human TNF ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,\r\n          USA) was used to determine the concentration of TNF in\r\n          plasma from peripheral blood, in accordance with the\r\n          manufacturer's instructions. The TNF-? standard was made\r\n          up as directed to read a maximum concentration of 1000\r\n          pg/ml and a minimum of 15.6 pg/ml.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Statistical analysis\r\n          Analysis was by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)\r\n          with post hoc Bonferroni adjustment (all-means\r\n          comparison) test, using the Graphpad ?Prism version 3.00\r\n          for Windows (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Results\r\n        \r\n          Optimization and specificity of the TTP polyclonal\r\n          antibody\r\n          To determine the optimal working concentration of the\r\n          TTP antibody, 293 cells transfected with TTP were fixed,\r\n          permeabilized, and stained at various concentrations of\r\n          antibody or IgG control. There was a\r\n          concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence (Fig.\r\n          1a), which was standardized using fluorescent\r\n          microspheres in order to compare different experiments\r\n          and cell types [ 31 ] . The optimum concentration of\r\n          antibody was determined to be 3.8 ?g per 5 ? 10 5cells,\r\n          where the intensity curve began to flatten. At higher\r\n          concentrations, the MESF value for the control sera\r\n          increased concordantly, indicating nonspecific binding.\r\n          Specificity of the TTP antibody was determined by\r\n          blocking with the identical peptide sequence used to\r\n          generate the polyclonal antibody. In the presence of\r\n          blocking TTP peptide, at concentrations either 10 or 50\r\n          times the amount of TTP antibody used, the detection of\r\n          the TTP protein within the transfected cells was nearly\r\n          eliminated (Fig. 1b).\r\n          Confocal sectioning of transfected 293 cells showed\r\n          that the presence of TTP protein was primarily in the\r\n          cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1c). Z sections taken every\r\n          0.5 ?m through the cell showed little, if any, TTP within\r\n          the nucleus. In nontransfected 293 cells, a small amount\r\n          of TTP was detected by flow cytometry and confirmed by\r\n          confocal microscopy. Transfected 293 cells expressed nine\r\n          times as much TTP as the untransfected cells at the\r\n          optimal working concentration of antibody. Preincubation\r\n          of the nontransfected 293 cells with TTP peptide blocked\r\n          the activity, confirming its identity. These results\r\n          confirmed our previously published data in which Western\r\n          blot analysis showed that TTP was localized in the\r\n          cytoplasmic extract of 293 cells [ 24 ] .\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Induction of TTP in the THP-1 cell line\r\n          Since TNF biosynthesis in macrophages is rapidly\r\n          triggered by treatment with LPS, the effects of this\r\n          endotoxin on TTP expression were examined. THP-1 cells, a\r\n          human myelomonocytic cell line, were incubated with and\r\n          without LPS (0.1 ?g/ml) for up to 24 hours. At\r\n          representative time points, a sample was removed and\r\n          stained with either anti-TTP or the IgG control, as\r\n          described in Materials and methods. The addition of LPS\r\n          rapidly increased the expression of TTP by THP-1 cells\r\n          (Fig. 2a). Increases in TTP were detectable 1 hour after\r\n          stimulation and were still evident in the cytosol 4 hours\r\n          after LPS treatment. Analysis of the cells by confocal\r\n          microscopy (Fig. 2b) confirmed the upregulation and\r\n          indicated that the TTP was expressed intracellularly,\r\n          relatively homogeneously but confined to the cytoplasm.\r\n          These data show that LPS stimulation rapidly increases\r\n          human TTP protein expression in the cytoplasm. The\r\n          kinetics of induction by LPS parallels that seen with TTP\r\n          mRNA in bone-marrow-derived murine macrophages [ 23 ]\r\n          .\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          In vitroTTP induction with LPS in peripheral blood\r\n          leukocytes\r\n          Modulation of TTP expression by LPS was subsequently\r\n          examined in normal peripheral leukocytes. Whole blood\r\n          from eight healthy volunteers was incubated at 37?C alone\r\n          or with LPS (0.1 ?g/ml) for up to 24 hours. At periodic\r\n          time points, a sample was taken and leukocytes were\r\n          purified by dextran sedimentation, fixed, permeabilized,\r\n          and then stained with either anti-TTP or control\r\n          antibody. In leukocytes, constitutive expression of TTP\r\n          ranged from approximately 9 ? 10 3to 35 ? 10 3MESF.\r\n          Monocytes constitutively expressed over three times as\r\n          much TTP as either lymphocytes or neutrophils (Table 1).\r\n          Stimulation with LPS \r\n          in vitro produced an increase in\r\n          TTP expression in all leukocyte subpopulations. This was\r\n          maximal 2 hours after stimulation. TTP levels increased\r\n          to a higher maximal level in monocytes than in other\r\n          leukocytes (+8.5 ? 10 3MESF; Fig. 3a). Two-color flow\r\n          cytometry indicated that CD4 +and CD8 +T lymphocytes\r\n          expressed equivalent amounts of TTP (data not shown). The\r\n          kinetics of TTP induction with LPS was consistent and\r\n          monophasic in all leukocytes (Fig. 3i). The change in TTP\r\n          expression was greatest in neutrophils and least in\r\n          lymphocytes. Since lymphocytes lack Toll-like receptor 4\r\n          and express little or no CD14 [ 33 ] , we conclude that\r\n          the induction of TTP in these cells was occurring\r\n          indirectly, presumably through stimulation with TNF,\r\n          although other cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8,\r\n          could contribute to this response.\r\n          LPS-induced TTP upregulation was confirmed in all cell\r\n          types by confocal microscopy. Analysis confirmed an\r\n          increase in TTP in neutrophils 2 hours after stimulation\r\n          (Fig. 3). Similar data were obtained for lymphocytes and\r\n          monocytes (data not shown). Distribution in resting\r\n          levels and after stimulation with LPS was primarily\r\n          cytosolic, which is in accord with our data for 293 and\r\n          THP-1 cells.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Correlation of in vivoTTP production with TNF after\r\n          LPS bolus\r\n          To study the kinetics of TTP induction \r\n          in vivo , we infused 4 ng/kg of\r\n          clinical-grade endotoxin at time 0 in four volunteers.\r\n          Blood was drawn before the infusion and at specified\r\n          intervals afterwards, and aliquots were analyzed for\r\n          leukocyte cell counts, TTP expression, and plasma TNF\r\n          levels.\r\n          The cell counts of all the leukocyte subpopulations in\r\n          all the volunteers fell rapidly, as seen 1 hour after\r\n          infusion in all volunteers (Fig. 4a,4b,4c), in\r\n          concordance with published data [ 34 35 36 ] . Beyond the\r\n          1-hour time point, the neutrophil cell count increased,\r\n          reaching a peak at 12 hours. It then decreased to\r\n          baseline values at 24 hours (Fig. 4a). Lymphocyte and\r\n          monocyte data showed similar initial kinetics. The\r\n          lymphocyte and monocyte curves were biphasic, peaking at\r\n          4 hours, dropping to baseline at 12 hours, and beginning\r\n          a second increase at 48 hours.\r\n          Plasma TNF levels were analyzed throughout the study.\r\n          The circulating TNF level increased to a peak at 2 hours\r\n          after infusion (Fig. 4d). After 12 hours, there was no\r\n          detectable TNF in any of the four volunteers. This\r\n          monophasic peak was consistent with findings in other\r\n          studies [ 37 ] .\r\n          Analysis of TTP expression in leukocyte populations\r\n          before and after LPS infusion revealed a biphasic\r\n          induction, with an initial peak occurring within 4 hours\r\n          and a second after 12 hours (Fig. 5a,5b,5c). Baseline and\r\n          maximum TTP expression in each cell type for each\r\n          volunteer is presented in Table 2. The expression and\r\n          initial upregulation of TTP in response to LPS in all\r\n          leukocyte populations was consistent with the data found \r\n          in vitro . Neutrophils responded\r\n          rapidly to LPS infusion, reaching an initial peak within\r\n          an hour of infusion, although the average increase in the\r\n          four volunteers appears to be moderate (50%). Analysis of\r\n          monocytic TTP showed an increase in expression, peaking\r\n          at 2 hours (Fig. 5b). Lymphocyte TTP expression peaked at\r\n          4 hours, which was later than the initial peak response\r\n          of neutrophils and monocytes (Fig. 5c). A second, more\r\n          dramatic, rise, which did not parallel changes in plasma\r\n          TNF levels (Fig. 5d), was observed 12 hours after\r\n          infusion in all leukocyte populations.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          TNF contribution in LPS induction of TTP\r\n          The human \r\n          in vivo studies described here show\r\n          increases in circulating plasma TNF that preceded TTP\r\n          induction in all the leukocyte types investigated. This\r\n          observation is consistent with the hypothesis that LPS\r\n          mediates induction of TTP through the production of TNF.\r\n          However, this hypothesis does not explain the second rise\r\n          in TTP we observed \r\n          in vivo , which was not associated\r\n          with TNF. To examine this phenomena in more detail, THP-1\r\n          cells were cultured with LPS or TNF in the presence of\r\n          blocking TNF antibody. The antibody sequesters TNF in the\r\n          supernatant, preventing its interaction with TNF\r\n          receptors. LPS induced greater TTP expression than TNF\r\n          (Fig. 6a,6b). When THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS\r\n          in the presence of the blocking TNF antibody, the TTP\r\n          response was reduced but not eliminated (Fig. 6a). In\r\n          fact, the initial induction of TTP detectable during the\r\n          first hour was unaffected, suggesting that TNF was not\r\n          solely responsible for the LPS-induced rise. In contrast,\r\n          TNF induction of TTP by THP-1 cells was completely\r\n          blocked in the presence of the blocking TNF antibody\r\n          (Fig. 6b).\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Discussion\r\n        This study is the first to evaluate the expression and\r\n        regulation of endogenous human TTP in myeloid and lymphoid\r\n        cells. It is the first to examine the subcellular\r\n        localization of native TTP protein in freshly isolated\r\n        cells, since all previous studies relied on prolonged cell\r\n        culture or transfection/overexpression approaches using\r\n        cell lines [ 20 21 22 24 25 ] . We show that endogenous\r\n        human TTP is expressed in neutrophils, lymphocytes, and\r\n        monocytes. They are significant in their demonstration that\r\n        native human TTP is totally cytoplasmic; there was little\r\n        evidence of nuclear localization in these studies, an\r\n        observation that is consistent with previous work with\r\n        human TTP, in which immunoblotting showed cytoplasmic\r\n        localization [ 24 ] .\r\n        The discrepancy between our findings and findings of\r\n        nuclear localization of TTP may be due to several factors [\r\n        20 21 22 24 25 ] . First, most of those studies did not\r\n        measure endogenous TTP but usually relied on transfection\r\n        of cell lines, perhaps resulting in mislocalization due to\r\n        the presence of an epitope tag or overexpression [ 20 21 22\r\n        24 25 ] . Second, by definition, those cells were largely\r\n        cycling and thus were not representative of normal\r\n        hematopoietic cells. Third, mouse or rat TTP was used in\r\n        those studies [ 20 21 22 25 ] . Although highly conserved,\r\n        it is possible that human TTP is subtly different from\r\n        rodent TTP. We think this unlikely, as immunoprecipitation\r\n        studies of bone-marrow-derived murine macrophages show\r\n        murine TTP predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction [ 23 ]\r\n        . This matter requires further analysis once improved\r\n        antibodies to murine TTP are generated.\r\n        Our studies clearly showed human TTP in lymphocytes and\r\n        neutrophils, in addition to monocytes. Early work by\r\n        Carballo and colleagues [ 38 ] showed the importance of\r\n        macrophages, not lymphocytes, in the development of the\r\n        phenotype associated with TTP deficiency. This highlights\r\n        the importance of macrophages in the production of TNF,\r\n        supported by current hypotheses on the pivotal role of this\r\n        cell type in TNF overproduction in autoimmune diseases [ 39\r\n        ] . Thus, our findings suggest that TTP serves an entirely\r\n        different role in other leukocytes, relative to their role\r\n        in regulating cytokine production by macrophages, and that\r\n        TNF production is not simply regulated by TTP.\r\n        Despite these potential differences in the function of\r\n        human TTP based on cell type, our studies show a common\r\n        pattern of induction by LPS in monocytes, neutrophils, and\r\n        lymphocytes. The upregulation of human TTP occurs rapidly,\r\n        within the first hour of stimulation. This is consistent\r\n        with murine data demonstrating that upregulation occurs\r\n        within 30 min of LPS stimulation, remaining high for 4\r\n        hours [ 23 ] . Using confocal imaging, we found TTP was\r\n        primarily detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, confirming\r\n        our earlier immunoblotting studies [ 24 ] .\r\n        LPS stimulation of peripheral blood leukocytes \r\n        in vitro revealed TTP-induction\r\n        kinetics analogous to that observed for THP-1 cells. We\r\n        used a whole blood assay, since the cytokines produced\r\n        after \r\n        in vitro incubation with LPS are\r\n        analogous to those produced after \r\n        in vivo infusion, providing an\r\n        important model of sepsis [ 40 ] . Baseline expression of\r\n        TTP was higher in monocytes than in either lymphocytes or\r\n        neutrophils. Lymphocytes responded the least to LPS\r\n        stimulation, whereas monocytes responded the most.\r\n        Monocytes were not followed beyond 4 hours after\r\n        stimulation with LPS, because of the low numbers of cells\r\n        retrieved, probably due to upregulation of adhesion\r\n        molecules (ICAM-1) [ 41 ] .\r\n        The induction of TTP expression by either LPS or TNF has\r\n        not been studied in an \r\n        in vivo system before. In this study,\r\n        four human volunteers were infused with LPS and the\r\n        subsequent changes in leukocyte cell count, TTP expression\r\n        in leukocyte subpopulations, and levels of TNF were\r\n        followed over a 72-hour period. Although there was some\r\n        individual variability in the overall kinetics, basal\r\n        levels and the initial induction of TTP by LPS were within\r\n        the range observed \r\n        in vitro (Tables 1and 2). All cell\r\n        types showed an increase in TTP expression within the first\r\n        hour. Interestingly, TTP was induced by LPS \r\n        in vivo more slowly (after 4 hours vs\r\n        1-2 hours) and to a lesser degree in the lymphocyte\r\n        population than in neutrophils or monocytes. The absence of\r\n        LPS-signal transducers (CD14, Toll-like receptor 4) on most\r\n        lymphocytes relative to monocytes and neutrophils may\r\n        account for this altered expression [ 42 43 ] . Since\r\n        lymphocytes express TNF receptors and TNF itself can induce\r\n        TTP mRNA expression [ 38 ] , these data are consistent with\r\n        the interpretation that TTP induction in lymphocytes is\r\n        transduced not by LPS binding, but by TNF produced by\r\n        monocytes and/or neutrophils acting on lymphocytes.\r\n        The initial fall in leukocyte cell count observed \r\n        in vivo is in accord with published\r\n        data [ 34 35 36 ] . The numbers of monocytes and\r\n        neutrophils dropped within the first hour, by approximately\r\n        98% and 76%, respectively, and of lymphocytes, by 80% after\r\n        4 hours. This decrease is consistent with data suggesting\r\n        that the reduction in leukocytes results from a decrease in\r\n        granulocytes and monocytes as they become activated,\r\n        migrating and adhering to vascular endothelium [ 44 ] .\r\n        This drop in cell numbers was followed by an increase in\r\n        all leukocyte populations, beginning at 12 hours and\r\n        continuing through the 72-hour time point. This raises the\r\n        issue of whether the apparent changes in TTP expression\r\n        were due, in part, to differential rates of margination by\r\n        leukocyte subpopulations. Since the levels of TTP induction\r\n        seen in the first hour \r\n        in vivo approximate those seen \r\n        in vitro , we believe that this\r\n        induction reflects the increased synthesis and expression\r\n        of TTP by all leukocyte subpopulations and is consistent\r\n        with the kinetics of their mRNA induction [ 23 ] .\r\n        TTP and TNF are reportedly involved in a\r\n        negative-feedback loop, in which increases in TNF\r\n        concentration are associated with induction of TTP [ 23 ] .\r\n        In these studies, LPS, which induces the release of TNF [\r\n        45 ] , produced a rise in TTP within 4 hours of\r\n        stimulation. Although the initial rise in TTP \r\n        in vivo paralleled a rapid and\r\n        considerable increase in plasma TNF, the second, late\r\n        increases in intracellular TTP did not reflect TNF levels.\r\n        This change may have been mediated by other cytokines\r\n        (IL-1?, IL-8) whose levels have been shown to increase with\r\n        kinetics that parallel this rise in TTP [ 40 46 47 ] .\r\n        Alternatively, the late rise in cytoplasmic TTP may be due\r\n        to release from the bone marrow of leukocytes that have\r\n        high levels of TTP or an adaptive response to\r\n        endotoxemia.\r\n        TNF overproduction mediates both sepsis and chronic\r\n        inflammatory disorders such as RA. Its production may be\r\n        modulated at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and\r\n        post-translational levels [ 48 49 50 ] . Many of the\r\n        effects observed after LPS stimulation can be attributed to\r\n        subsequent production of TNF. Moreover, infusion of TNF\r\n        initiates inflammatory processes, with a resulting\r\n        phenotype that is indistinguishable from bacterial sepsis [\r\n        13 14 ] . We investigated the contribution of TNF in the\r\n        LPS-mediated induction of TTP in THP-1 cells using a\r\n        blocking TNF antibody. TNF induction of TTP expression was\r\n        almost completely eliminated by incubation with the TNF\r\n        inhibitor, proving the direct effect of TNF on TTP\r\n        induction. LPS, however, induced much greater levels of TTP\r\n        in THP-1 cells than TNF did. In the presence of blocking\r\n        TNF antibody, LPS induction of TTP was initially unaffected\r\n        but began to decline after 1 hour, suggesting that LPS\r\n        itself may mediate the initial increases in TTP and showing\r\n        that the prolonged induction of TTP is dependent on\r\n        TNF.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Conclusion\r\n        We have shown through an intracellular staining assay\r\n        that human TTP expression is modulated by LPS and TNF.\r\n        LPS-induction of TTP was partly dependent on the production\r\n        of TNF. The ability of LPS to induce TTP independently of\r\n        TNF may account for the earlier response observed in\r\n        neutrophils and monocytes that have LPS-signaling\r\n        transduction molecules. In contrast, lymphocytes\r\n        demonstrate a delayed and lower TTP response and are\r\n        probably responding to TNF, or other cytokines, produced by\r\n        myeloid cells. In addition, a second rise in TTP expression\r\n        was observed \r\n        in vivo , which did not correlate\r\n        with any detectable rise in TNF concentration, implying\r\n        that there are additional factors involved in the\r\n        regulation of this intracellular protein. TNF is a\r\n        predominant proinflammatory cytokine, particularly in\r\n        sepsis and chronic inflammatory disorders suggesting that\r\n        the role of its negative regulator, TTP, may be of\r\n        functional importance in the development and pathogenesis\r\n        of disease. Investigating any potential abnormalities in\r\n        expression or regulation may prove to be a valuable\r\n        therapeutic intervention.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Competing interests\r\n
