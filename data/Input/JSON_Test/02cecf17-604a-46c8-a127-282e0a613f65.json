Last May, the Republican-controlled Congress voted to","priority":"Normal","contentType":"multipart/alternative","sentDate":"2017-11-06T23:57:16","importance":"Normal","plainTextBody":"\r\n   \r\n   \r\n      \r\n         \r\n            Defining Disaster Down\r\n\r\n            When they closed the wedding\r\nchapels, brothels, and even the 24-hour casinos in Nevada early this month, I\r\nknew that disaster had truly struck. \"It's a strange feeling to see the casinos\r\ndark,\" said a Harrah's spokeswoman. Sort of like when Winston Churchill noticed\r\nthe lights going out all over Europe.\r\n\r\n            Until\r\nthen, I had been skeptical about media reports of natural disasters. Earlier\r\nthat week, Washington's governor had declared an emergency in several parts of\r\nhis state after it had been hit by a set of snowstorms (this was before warm\r\nrain turned the snow into floodwater). A Slate colleague in Redmond, a Seattle\r\nsuburb and the home of Microsoft, allowed that the roads were treacherous and\r\nthat a lot of people were without electricity. But somehow, it didn't feel like\r\nan \"emergency\" to a man who had grown up in the Midwest, where they know from\r\nblizzards. \"Have we gotten soft?\" he wondered.\r\n\r\n            Well, have we? Having lowered our standards on what\r\nconstitutes commonly acceptable behavior--\",\" as Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\r\nD-N.Y., famously put it--have we also reduced the threshold for commonly\r\naccepted calamity? Have we \"defined disaster down\"? Only in this case--unlike\r\nin Moynihan's--the redefinition has served to increase, rather than decrease,\r\nthe required level of government intervention, shifting to the national\r\ntreasury responsibility for hardships that individuals and localities once\r\nstoically assumed.\r\n\r\n            Only an\r\nincorrigible cynic would suspect the victims of quakes, tornadoes, and\r\nwildfires of smiling at the thought of the fat government relief check that\r\nwould enable them to pack up for sunnier climes, or at least to replace that\r\ncrummy old carpeting in the living room. And yet, the data do suggest that\r\nsomething more than outrageous fortune is at work.\r\n\r\n            \r\nSpending on disasters by the Federal Emergency\r\nManagement Agency burgeoned to $13 billion over the last five years from $3.3\r\nbillion over the previous five. Billions more were spent collectively by some\r\n28 other federal agencies such as the Small Business Administration and the\r\ndepartments of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development,\r\nAgriculture, and the Interior. Before 1993, no snowstorm or blizzard had been\r\ndeclared a \"major disaster or emergency\" by the president (though federal help\r\nhad been offered in a dozen or so other \"winter events\" in which additional\r\ndamage, such as the downing of utility lines, had occurred). Since 1993, nearly\r\nfour dozen severe winter storms have been so designated, 17 in 1996 alone. Last\r\nyear, in fact, was a banner year for calamity: FEMA found itself responding to\r\n75 major disasters and eight emergencies so designated by the White House. The\r\nprevious record, of 45 disasters and two emergencies, was set in 1992.\r\n\r\n            Of\r\ncourse, both 1992 and 1996 were election years. An unscientific mind, noting\r\nthe tendency of relief aid to gravitate toward electorally rich states, might\r\neven conclude that the gods of mayhem conspire with incumbents to provide\r\ncalamitous occasions for the demonstration of political compassion. After all,\r\nCalifornia, with 54 electoral votes, received 55 percent of federal disaster\r\naid from 1989 to 1994, and Florida, with 20 votes, garnered 20 percent.\r\n\r\n            John Solomon, who provides these last data in an article in\r\nthe October 1996 Washington \r\n               Monthly , offers a less credulous\r\nexplanation: Disaster relief is \"a unique example of political pork that\r\neveryone accepts as kosher.\"\r\n\r\n            Yes, it's\r\npork, but we are a wealthy country. Why shouldn't we all pitch in and help each\r\nother out when times are tough? True, Clinton's appetite for greenbacked\r\ncompassion is keen. (In September 1996, when Hurricane Fran upended Durham,\r\nN.C., the local Herald-Sun agreed to distribute a FEMA advice booklet,\r\nonly to discover--according to the paper's editor--that the booklet was held up\r\nfor five crucial days so that it could be reworked to feature pictures of, and\r\nmessages from, the president and Democratic Gov. Jim Hunt.) Still, it's a\r\nbipartisan taste, and when both parties dig in, the banquet never ends.\r\n\r\n            \r\nMore than two years after the 1994 Northridge,\r\nCalif., earthquake, for example, HUD found itself still paying generous rent\r\nsubsidies to more than half of the 13,000 displaced lower-income residents who\r\nhad been granted \"temporary\" aid after the disaster. Many, according to a\r\nFebruary 1995 story in the Los \r\n               Angeles \r\n               Times , had been\r\nmoved to housing far superior to their disaster-damaged homes. Last May, the\r\nRepublican-controlled Congress voted to make the subsidies permanent.\r\n\r\n            Nor does\r\nit seem fair to blame the bureaucrats. FEMA got nothing but brickbats for its\r\nslow and stumbling performance in the aftermath of 1992's Hurricane Andrew.\r\nWhen, under Clinton appointee James Lee Witt, the agency finally earned rave\r\nnotices for its response to the Great Flood of 1993, only the dullest\r\nfunctionary could have missed the lesson: When you do battle with disaster, no\r\nmedals are awarded for being stingy.\r\n\r\n            Not surprisingly, examples abound of disaster-aid abuses\r\nand misuses over the last few years. James Bovard provides a useful compendium\r\nin the September 1996 American \r\n               Spectator , drawing on the periodic\r\ncritiques prepared by FEMA's own inspector general and the General Accounting\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n            Yet it's\r\nalso noteworthy that the bulk of the recommendations put forth by GAO came from\r\nFEMA regional officials themselves. These include ideas such as limiting the\r\nappeals that states and individuals can file if the feds decline to pick up\r\nrestoration costs--while these appeals are pending, FEMA has to pick up the\r\nfull costs of relocating not only families but also such expensive entities as\r\ncity halls and universities. Another idea: Eliminating help (including\r\nexpensive re-landscaping) now provided to golf courses, marinas, and other\r\nrevenue-generating enterprises that can well afford their own insurance.\r\n\r\n            \r\nNor does the agency harbor any illusions about\r\nthe \"moral hazards\" engendered by its fight against the hazards of nature. FEMA\r\nofficials could be heard last week bemoaning the fact that people just keep\r\nmoving back into the flood plains from which only a few years earlier they had\r\nbeen rescued, even as developers destroy more of the watershed that offered\r\nsome natural protection. Among the \"Frequently Asked Questions\" FEMA posts on\r\nits Web site is the following: \"I think that some people in my neighborhood are\r\ntrying to cheat the federal government out of disaster money. They don't seem\r\nto have the damage they claim they have, and they're bragging about it. Who can\r\nI report disaster fraud to?\"\r\n\r\n            But rule\r\nbending by individuals is probably penny ante stuff compared with the advantage\r\ntaken by states and their agencies, upon whom FEMA's tiny audit staff must rely\r\nto verify all but the largest grants. California officials have been especially\r\naggressive, muscling reluctant FEMA officials to expend billions on \"code\r\nupgrades\" requiring massive or even total reconstruction of buildings suffering\r\nrelatively minor damage. One FEMA inspector told GAO that some survey-damage\r\nreports after the Northridge quake included work that had been specifically\r\nrejected after the Loma Prieta quake five years earlier.\r\n\r\n            Local governments quickly learn bad lessons, too. If they\r\nare foolish enough to set aside reserves to cover their own cleanup costs after\r\nstorms and floods, they get no help at all. On the other hand, if, having\r\ngotten a FEMA loan to cover most of their emergency bills, they somehow fail to\r\nraise enough revenues to cover all their regular spending plus the payback cost\r\nthree years later, FEMA will forgive the debt. It may not surprise you to learn\r\nthat few loans are repaid. GAO offers examples of localities banking extra FEMA\r\nmoney and collecting interest on it. And now an imaginative but severely\r\ncrime-ridden neighborhood in Minneapolis is threatening to ask President\r\nClinton to declare their district a federal disaster area on the grounds that\r\nstate and local authorities can't or won't cope with their long-running\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n            In responding to GAO's\r\nrecommendations for reform, FEMA Director Witt noted that, however well taken,\r\nthey, like previous reforms, were likely to be rejected by Congress because\r\nthey would \"seriously affect benefits to the states and their citizens.\" Now\r\nyou know why the federal deficit is so big.\r\n\r\n            Witt wants to devote his\r\nefforts to \"mitigation\" instead, to helping localities prepare better for the\r\nnext disaster. Handing out a new kind of grant has, after all, a great deal\r\nmore political appeal than trying to crack down on the old kind. But, it's\r\nworth remembering when the next set of calamities hits your television\r\nscreen--or, far worse, your own community--that when we decide to \"nationalize\"\r\nour problems, the overhead tends to get very high, very fast. And some of the\r\nlargest costs are paid in the corrosion of those personal and community\r\nstandards that we claim to value most.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
