It happened when he fell\r\ndown the steps outside golfer Greg Norman's house in Florida March 14 at 1:20\r\na.m. Surgeons put him under local anesthesia while they reattached the tendon\r\nto his kneecap. Pundits rehashed the rules of succession in the event of\r\nsomething worse. For now, Vice President Gore is shouldering/indulging in the\r\npresident's less essential duties. Follow-up reports focused on what sort of\r\npainkillers Clinton is taking. Doctors say Clinton could be on crutches for up\r\nto eight weeks. The widely noted irony is that Clinton will be the invalid at\r\nhis meeting with Boris Yeltsin this week. (3/17)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               Dr.\r\nJack Kevorkian has opened an exhibit of his paintings. Among the images\r\nreported on by the New York Times are \"two hands holding up a severed\r\nhead by the hair,\" \"a man confronting his own severed head on a plate,\" and \"a\r\nman's brain and the upper end of his spinal column ... ripped from his body and\r\nhang[ing] from chains.\" Kevorkian says he stained one of the frames with his\r\nown blood. (3/17)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Jordan's King Hussein apologized in person to the families of seven\r\ngirls massacred by a Jordanian soldier. Accompanied by Israeli Prime Minister\r\nBenjamin Netanyahu, Hussein went to the families' homes, knelt before them, and\r\nasked their forgiveness. Israelis were moved, and commentators concluded that\r\nHussein is repairing his relations with Netanyahu. But Netanyahu refused to\r\nhalt an inflammatory Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, and Israel's justice\r\nminister, regarded as Netanyahu's closest aide, warned that if Palestinians\r\nreact violently to the settlement, there might be a \"war to the finish\" in\r\nwhich \"our response will reach Arafat himself.\" (3/17)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            News\r\nfrom the NCAA basketball tournament : 1) North Carolina Coach Dean Smith\r\nbroke the record for the most victories in college basketball. 2) Wake Forest,\r\nwhose center, Tim Duncan, is one of the most highly touted pro prospects in\r\nyears, was knocked out of the tourney. Commentators were disappointed that\r\nDuncan wasn't suitably rewarded for staying in college this year instead of\r\ngoing pro. 3) The early-round Cinderella team, Coppin State (Maryland),\r\nnarrowly missed squeaking through to the Sweet 16. (3/17)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Albania is imploding . (Primer: It's between Italy and Greece.) Nine\r\npyramid investment schemes collapsed, which wiped out the life savings of\r\nthousands of Albanians, which led to protests, which led to rebellion, which\r\nled to police giving loyalist civilians assault weapons, which led to gunfire,\r\nlooting, and roving bands of robbers. Inmates are escaping from jails, and the\r\npresident has lost control of the army. The European Union has agreed to send\r\nin a few dozen military and police advisers, but not a big force. The United\r\nStates wants Albania's president to step down, but he refuses to do so.\r\n\"Albanians themselves were unsure whether to call the violence a civil war, a\r\nrevolution, a popular uprising or just plain chaos,\" said the New York\r\nTimes . (3/17)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The\r\nanti-anti-cloning backlash is underway. At a Senate hearing, Republican\r\nsenators worried that a ban on human-cloning research might prevent lifesaving\r\nmedical breakthroughs, and researchers and ethicists said there is no need to\r\nlegislate hastily, since it will take a while to refine the sheep-cloning\r\ntechnique to work in humans. This comes after President Clinton banned federal\r\nfunding of human-cloning research and two lawmakers filed bills to ban human\r\ncloning. The New York Times reported that through in vitro\r\nfertilization, \"tens of thousands of embryos are steadily accumulating\r\nin tanks of liquid nitrogen\" in the United States, and their lives can be\r\nstarted at any time in the future. An elderly Milwaukee couple are soliciting\r\nwomen to conceive and bear their grandchild using frozen sperm from their dead\r\nson. (3/17)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                  Newsweek reports that Timothy McVeigh confessed to the Oklahoma\r\nCity bombing. This is the third such report in recent weeks. The first two\r\nappeared in the Dallas \r\n               Morning News and Playboy .\r\nNewsweek 's account, citing \"anonymous sources close to the\r\ninvestigation,\" says McVeigh confessed during a lie-detector test administered\r\nby his attorneys. (3/17)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Rebels in Zaire easily captured Kisangani, the country's third-largest\r\ncity, and are expected to head for the capital soon. Everyone is now convinced\r\nthat the loyalist army is a joke, and President Mobutu Sese Seko is finished.\r\nThe only catch is that Mobutu can't be physically deposed, since he's hiding\r\nout in France. (3/17)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Julius Rosenberg's former KGB contact has come forward. Alexander\r\nFeklisov says 1) that Rosenberg passed U.S. military secrets to the Russians\r\nbut 2) supplied no useful information about the atomic bomb, contrary to the\r\nassertions of J. Edgar Hoover, and 3) that Ethel Rosenberg, who was executed\r\nalong with her husband, did no spying for Feklisov. The bottom line, according\r\nto Feklisov, is that the executions were unjust. (3/17)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Update on the Democratic fund-raising scandal : 1) President\r\nClinton said FBI agents denied him advance warning about Chinese\r\ninfluence-buying efforts by telling his aides to keep the information secret.\r\nThe FBI then issued a statement contradicting Clinton. Pundits oohed and aahed\r\nover the quarrel. The next day everyone insisted it was just a\r\nmisunderstanding. Attorney General Janet Reno said she tried to tell National\r\nSecurity Adviser Tony Lake about the Chinese scheme 10 months ago but was\r\nunable to reach him by phone, so she asked the FBI to tell the White House,\r\nwhich led to the above fiasco. 2) The FBI warned six members of Congress last\r\nyear that China had targeted them for illegal campaign donations through\r\nforeign companies. 3) The New York Times reported that the\r\nadministration endorsed a project in China that was financially important to\r\nthe Riady family just after a Riady-controlled company put Webster Hubbell on\r\nits payroll. White House special counsel Lanny Davis said Clinton may have\r\nknown three years ago that his friends were subsidizing Hubbell.\r\n(3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Political fallout from the scandal: 1) The Senate expanded its\r\ninvestigation to include \"improper\" as well as illegal conduct in the 1996\r\nelections. This brings soft money and other much criticized practices under\r\nscrutiny. It is seen as a rebuke to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and a\r\nvictory for Democrats, Sen. Fred Thompson (who will chair the investigation),\r\nand campaign reform. 2) House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said he\r\nhas begun to examine impeachment procedures in the event they are justified. 3)\r\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said the White House knew of\r\nChinese efforts to influence U.S. elections a year sooner than the\r\nadministration admits, yet continued to raise money through Chinese-affiliated\r\nfund raisers. The White House denies this. 4) Clinton's job rating fell from 60\r\nto 55 points in a Washington Post poll, apparently because pollees\r\ndisapproved of his use of the White House for fund raising. 5) Dueling\r\nspins : The New York Times says the scandal will dog and impede\r\nClinton's foreign policy. The Washington Post says Clinton's foreign\r\ntravels will distract attention from the scandal. (3/17)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Republican fund-raising hypocrisy watch: 1) The Washington\r\n\r\n               Post reported that a Republican House committee counsel hit up\r\ninvestment firms for $100,000 contributions to the GOP shortly after working on\r\nfinancial-deregulation legislation. 2) Democrats released documents indicating\r\nthat Republicans sold big political donors meals with the party's leaders in\r\nfederal buildings in 1995. 3) The Washington \r\n               Post reported that\r\nfor $5,000, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is offering donors a\r\nchance to give Trent Lott and other senators \"advice\" at a forum next month.\r\n(3/12)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Other\r\nnews from abroad: 1) British Prime Minister John Major announced that a new\r\nnational election will be held May 1. Polls show the opposition Labor Party\r\nleading by nearly 2-to-1. 2) A Church of England priest has ignited a furor by\r\narguing that it's OK to shoplift from chain supermarkets because they're\r\ndriving local stores out of business. 3) A Pakistani woman won a historic court\r\nvictory allowing her to remain married to the man she loves (and with\r\nwhom she eloped) despite her parents' insistence that under Islamic law, they\r\nhave the sole authority to choose her husband. Her father is appealing to the\r\ncountry's supreme court. (3/17)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               TCI , the country's biggest cable-TV company, plans to raise its rates\r\nby 7 percent . This comes after TCI recently hiked its rates by 13 percent.\r\nCritics say the price increase proves 1) last year's telecommunications bill\r\nfailed to keep cable rates down as promised, and 2) competition from\r\nsatellite-dish TV services isn't deterring rate hikes either. Other cable\r\ncompanies are expected to follow suit if TCI gets away with the rate increase.\r\n(3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            A\r\nsuspect has been charged with the murder of Ennis Cosby . A $100,000\r\nreward offered by the National \r\n               Enquirer led to a tip, which led\r\npolice to the gun and the killer's cap, which led to the arrest of Mikail\r\nMarkhasev, an 18-year-old Russian ?migr? with a criminal background. Markhasev\r\nalso matches the description provided by the woman who allegedly saw the\r\ngunman. Early reports linked Markhasev to a Russian car-theft ring, but police\r\nnow say the killing looks like a random robbery attempt gone awry.\r\n(3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The\r\nTWA Flight 800 missile theory is back. A group headed by former ABC\r\nnewsman Pierre Salinger published a massive report in Paris \r\n               Match\r\nclaiming that a U.S. Navy missile blew up the plane. The key evidence cited in\r\nthe report: 1) a red residue on the plane's seats showing \"chemical elements\r\nconsistent with solid missile fuel\" and 2) a government radar tape showing a\r\nfast projectile on a collision course with the plane. Federal investigators\r\nsaid that lab tests show the residue is from standard glue used in plane seats.\r\nThey also seized the radar tape, examined it, and said it shows no missile. The\r\nWashington \r\n               Post groaned that the TWA mystery \"has become the\r\naviation equivalent of the Kennedy assassination\"--i.e., no amount of disproof\r\nsatisfies the conspiracy theorists. (3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               Five\r\nfemale soldiers say Army investigators pressured them to falsely\r\naccuse their superiors of rape. Four of the five say they had sex with\r\ntheir instructors, but that it was consensual. The women claim they were\r\npromised helpful transfers if they told investigators what they wanted to hear\r\nand threatened with retaliation if they didn't. The announcement was organized\r\nby the NAACP, which suspects racism in the investigation because all the\r\naccused officers are black, and most of the accusers, white. (3/12)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Germany\r\ntold the United States it would expel an American spy . Initial reports\r\nindicated the Germans were angry because the agent was conducting economic\r\nespionage against Germany. But U.S. officials now say that the agent was\r\ngathering intelligence on another country--most likely Iran--and that the\r\nGermans ordered the diplomat out because they're tired of the United States\r\nusing their country as a spy nest and keeping them in the dark about it.\r\nAmerican officials are asking Germany to let the agent stay. (3/12)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Russian President Boris\r\nYeltsin ordered a shake-up of his Cabinet. Yeltsin pledged to keep only two\r\naides: Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly\r\nChubais. The betting is that Chubais, a free-market advocate whom Yeltsin\r\npromoted just last week, can now put allies in key jobs and restart economic\r\nreforms. The Washington \r\n               Post declared that Yeltsin is back in the\r\nsaddle and is launching a much-needed second wave of economic reform. But the\r\nChicago \r\n               Tribune warned that Chubais will fail, because he is a\r\nlousy manager and everyone in Russia hates him.
