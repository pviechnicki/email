In\r\nfact, they are the wave of the past. Interracial marriages accounted for only\r\n2.2 percent of all marriages in the Current Population Survey of 1992, a gain\r\nof only two-tenths of a percent over 1980, and the number of mixed couplings\r\nactually decreased slightly in 1991. The census pattern suggests that slightly\r\nmore interracial couples will fall into each other's arms in the coming years\r\nbut that there will be nothing resembling a dramatic acceleration of marriage\r\nacross the color line.\r\n\r\n            But America already has almost 400 years of race\r\nmixing behind it, beginning with that first slave ship that sailed into\r\nJamestown harbor carrying slaves who were already pregnant by members of the\r\ncrew. Americans have grudgingly accepted the fact that sex between masters and\r\nslaves such as Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings was frequent, leading to a\r\nmany-hued race of people who do not look African at all, even though they call\r\nthemselves \"African-American.\" Outside of recent African immigrants to the\r\nUnited States, there are virtually no black Americans of purely African\r\ndescent, which is to say no black people who lack white ancestry, left in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n            Four centuries of race\r\nmixing have had a similar impact on Americans who define themselves as white.\r\nConvincing estimates show that by 1950 about one in five white Americans had\r\nsome African ancestry. This inheritance most often arrived at the bedroom door\r\nin the form of a fair-skinned black person who had slipped over the color line\r\nto live as white. Put another way, most Americans with African blood in their\r\nveins think of themselves as white and conduct themselves as such--and check\r\n\"white\" when they fill out census forms.\r\n\r\n            How did so much \"black\" blood get into so many \"white\"\r\npeople? Consider the story behind the 1967 case of Loving vs. Virginia ,\r\nin which the Supreme Court overturned laws in 17 states that forbade black\r\npeople and white people to marry. Richard Loving was white and Mildred Jeter\r\nwas black. In 1958, weeks after the two were married, the Caroline County\r\nsheriff dragged them from their marriage bed and jailed them for the crime of\r\nbeing married. The Lovings were then exiled from Virginia under pain of\r\nimprisonment. In banishing the couple from the Old Dominion, the Caroline\r\nCounty judge said from the bench: \"Almighty God created the races, white,\r\nblack, yellow, Malay, and red and placed them on separate continents, and but\r\nfor the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such\r\nmarriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend\r\nthe races to mix.\"\r\n\r\n            This statement would have\r\nbeen ludicrous anyplace but was especially laughable in Caroline County--and in\r\nthe Lovings' hometown of Central Point, which had been an epicenter of race\r\nmixing for at least 200 years. There were many such centers in the South. In\r\ncities such as Charleston, S.C., and New Orleans, for example, white families\r\nand their fair-skinned black relatives lived so close together that they bumped\r\ninto each other on the street. Mixed-race people were initially treated as a\r\n\"new people\" who existed in the space between white and black and deserved a\r\nstatus not quite as high as whites but higher than that of black people in\r\ngeneral. This special status began to dry up just before the Civil War and\r\nevaporated when slavery ended and free blacks competed with whites for jobs and\r\npolitical power. White Southerners became obsessed with drawing an impossible\r\nline that would preserve white \"racial purity\"--another way of referring to\r\nwhite political dominance. The \"one-drop rule\" defined as black anyone who had\r\nany black ancestry at all, even if that ancestry was invisible to the naked eye\r\nor in the genealogical record. Those who fell on the black side of the law\r\noften lost the rights to vote, to hold high-status jobs, and to defend their\r\npersons and property in the courts.\r\n\r\n            The revocation of special mulatto rights accelerated the\r\npractice of passing for white. Central Point was locally known as the \"passing\r\ncapital of the world.\" Passing for white was so common there that a section of\r\nCentral Point had actually been named \"Passing.'' Some Central Pointers lived\r\nas negroes at home but crossed the line to seize white privileges just an hour\r\nor two away in Richmond, Va. Local children were often taken for white during\r\nexcursions to nearby towns, where they shopped in stores that did not serve\r\nblacks and were admitted to the \"white only\" sections of movie houses.\r\n\r\n            Having learned the\r\nrewards of whiteness early, these children grew up, moved away, and continued\r\nthe charade. Those who entered the armed forces, which were segregated until\r\n1948, were often classified as white and attached to all-white units. This made\r\nfor dicey moments when brown-skinned classmates from Central Point turned up in\r\nall-black units. Some of these former classmates kept the secret, but a few\r\nexposed the passers as frauds. Neither Britain nor France had laws that forbade\r\ninterracial marriage, and people in those countries had no clue what the Yanks\r\nwere going on about when they argued over who was really white or really black.\r\nTo the French and the British, race was defined by what you looked like: If you\r\nlooked white, well then, you were.\r\n\r\n            Back in Caroline County, soldiers who were passing were\r\nsure to travel home alone to prevent their white buddies from knowing who and\r\nwhat they were. The passers from Passing married white spouses, moved into\r\nwhite jobs, took up residence in white neighborhoods. When the couples returned\r\nto Central Point to visit, the town went along with the masquerade. Families\r\nditched brown-skinned friends and relatives, and children stayed out of school\r\nto avoid being seen on the colored bus headed to the colored school. Principals\r\nand teachers stuck to the script. One of them told Ebony magazine in\r\n1967 that blacks in Central Point had \"infiltrated the white race more than any\r\nother group of Negroes. When a student plays hooky from school for a week and\r\nsays an in-law is visiting the family, we understand. The kids just can't\r\nafford to catch the Negro school bus without giving away the racial\r\nidentity.\"\r\n\r\n            This infiltration was\r\ncommon not just in Virginia but all over the United States. The most\r\ninteresting document listed in the amicus briefs for Loving vs. Virginia\r\nis a statistical study called \"African Ancestry of the White American\r\nPopulation\" by Robert Stuckert, a sociologist and anthropologist from Ohio\r\nState University. Stuckert's statistical models are tough going, but\r\neye-opening for what they show. Simply put, he examined census and fertility\r\ndata to arrive at estimates of how many white Americans had African blood lines\r\nand how many fair-skinned blacks had crossed over the line to live as white.\r\nStuckert's tables show that during the 1940s alone, roughly 15,550 fair-skinned\r\nblacks per year slipped across the color line--about 155,500 for the decade.\r\nStuckert estimates that by 1950 about 21 percent of the whites--or about 28\r\nmillion of the 135 million persons classified as \"white\" in the census--had\r\nblack ancestry within the last four generations. He predicted that the\r\nproportion would only grow in the coming decades. The belief that one's\r\nancestors are \"racially uniform\" is a basic American fiction, Stuckert wrote,\r\nbut a fiction nonetheless.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
