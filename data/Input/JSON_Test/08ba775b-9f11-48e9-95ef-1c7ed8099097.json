Yesterday, to be exact, at half past 11\r\no'clock on an impossibly sunny morning overlooking the San Francisco Bay and\r\nits spectacular Golden Gate Bridge. There was a touch of wind blowing off the\r\nwater, which was enough to keep my guests cool, but not enough to blow their\r\ncarefully coifed hair into a mousse mess. The amber light sparkled all along\r\nthe bay as the city of San Francisco lay like a crown jewel in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n            If I say so myself, it was a completely perfect wedding to go along with the\r\nperfect weather. There were of course the superficial details of the\r\nevent--from the wildflower arch in front of which we took our vows to the tower\r\nof festively decorated individual cupcakes that an ingenious baker hand\r\nfashioned into a unique kind of wedding cake to the delightful surprise I got\r\nyesterday each time I noticed the antique ring around my finger that had\r\npreviously and always been bare. And there were the much more profound moments\r\nthat come from finally committing to a person for the rest of your\r\nlife--looking into each other's eyes as you are promising to love and cherish\r\none another, the joy radiating from the sea of faces of loved ones who had\r\ntraveled from near and far to share in the event, the rush of happiness as\r\ntheir glasses clinked in a unified toast to our shared lives that lay ahead\r\nwith so much possibility.\r\n\r\n            Imagine my chagrin then, to read an AP story that had popped up over the\r\nsame weekend that several Republican presidential candidates had pledged to\r\noppose allowing gays and lesbians to adopt children, same-sex relationships\r\nunder the term \"marriage,\" discussion of homosexuality in schools, and federal\r\nlaws to specifically protect homosexuals from discrimination, part of an\r\noverall effort by a dozen anti-gay groups in this latest election cycle.\r\n\r\n            Well, since I had just held one of these dreaded same-sex weddings (icky\r\nterm, don't you think?--I prefer my nephew's \"bride-bride\" hitching\r\nphraseology), I guess they told me. Except, of course, I don't seem to be\r\npaying an ounce of attention to the continuing and perplexingly tireless\r\nefforts of these groups and the candidates they manage to strong-arm into\r\nintolerance. Apparently, a great gob of Republicans had signed on, although\r\nonly Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch and publisher Steve Forbes (and, no, even though his\r\nfather, Malcolm, was widely rumored to be gay, I am not going to go there in\r\nthis obviously ironic twist of dysfunctional familial fate) had confirmed their\r\npledges.\r\n\r\n            One plus, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, GOP's Xena Elizabeth Dole, and\r\ncurrent phenom Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, did not sign, along with\r\nDemocratic candidates Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the former U.S.\r\nsenator from New Jersey and all around nice-seeming fellow.\r\n\r\n            So what am I to make of all this? The anti-gay groups never seem to want to\r\ngive up on their battle to meddle in the private lives of American citizens,\r\nwhile more and more people are learning more and more about the lives of gay\r\npeople like me every day. The venues are many--from massive news coverage of\r\nthe coming out of a television star named Ellen (I loved the \"Yep, I'm Gay\"\r\ntitle in Time magazine--it was more like \"Of course, she's a big homo,\"\r\nsince most of gay America had gaydared Ms. Degeneres from the second she walked\r\nonscreen) to the tragedy of the brutal and senseless killing of Matthew\r\nShepherd. Now, I am not a political person--in fact, I am nearly\r\nanti-political. Being a reporter all my life, I have naturally shunned any\r\nside-taking. And covering the Internet as I do now, it's not GOP for me, but\r\nIPO.\r\n\r\n            And yet, there I was yesterday, standing up in front of a crowd of 140\r\npeople--and hundreds more the night before at a pre-wedding party we also\r\nthrew--doing something that is apparently at the heart of our current political\r\ndebate. Now, I know I live in San Francisco--the Super Bowl of sin cities to\r\nsome--but I did not get the feeling that I was some radical cancer that had\r\ninvaded the body politic. I simply felt like I was someone in love with a\r\nkindred soul, who wanted to be able to declare that in a way that had been\r\ngoing on since the beginning of time.\r\n\r\n            It's hard to imagine then that, given these complex times, with so many\r\nimportant issues to deal with that are likely to challenge this country going\r\nforward, there seems to be such intense focus on this topic. I'd like to know\r\nwhat you think about this, because I cannot for the life of me see why this\r\nissue seems to inflame so many. Is it the religious thing? Is it the last gasp\r\nof a former culture that wants to hold back the new one? Is it just a\r\nsmokescreen to inflame voters rather than actually inform them? I only know the\r\nwords of guest after guest who came up to toast my partner, who talked of love,\r\ncommitment, family, and the future, and not much of politics.\r\n\r\n            My partner told one guest she was marrying, but it was a girl and not a\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n            \"Well,\" came the response. \"People have been marrying girls for\r\ncenturies.\"\r\n\r\n            I could not have said it better myself. So I won't.\r\n\r\n            Cheers,\r\nKara\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
