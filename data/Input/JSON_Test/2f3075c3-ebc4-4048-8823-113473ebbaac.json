Differential microarray\r\n        co-hybridization assays measure the relative gene\r\n        expression of paired query and reference samples, and the\r\n        power of microarray analysis comes from identification of\r\n        informative patterns of gene expression across multiple\r\n        experiments. Achieving both these objectives is facilitated\r\n        by using a common reference sample that provides a baseline\r\n        expression measure for each gene, enabling normalization\r\n        and comparison of independent experiments.\r\n        Pooled RNA derived from cell lines is a commonly used\r\n        reference sample. To provide optimal coverage of genes\r\n        spotted on the array, reference samples are often\r\n        constructed from a large number of cell lines from a\r\n        variety of tissues. One example is the universal human RNA\r\n        reference commercially available from Stratagene [ 3]. This\r\n        reference consists of equimolar quantities of RNA from ten\r\n        human cancer cell lines representing ten different tissues\r\n        (B cells, breast, brain, cervix, liver, lipocytes,\r\n        macrophage, skin, T cells and testis).\r\n        Another challenging technical consideration in\r\n        microarray analysis is the cutoff value used to distinguish\r\n        differential expression from natural variability in the\r\n        data. A cutoff of twofold up- or down-regulation has been\r\n        chosen to define differential expression in most published\r\n        studies [ 1, 2]. However, little has been done to evaluate\r\n        the accuracy of the technique and assess the confidence\r\n        levels for various fold-level changes in expression ratios.\r\n        In addition, microarray analysis is a complex, multistep\r\n        technique involving array fabrication, labeling,\r\n        hybridization and data analysis, and many laboratories have\r\n        developed a variety of protocols for each of these steps [\r\n        4, 5]. Studies by a number of groups using a range of\r\n        protocols and including many different RNA samples will\r\n        give a better picture of how reliable microarrays are for\r\n        elucidating gene-expression profiles.\r\n        In this study, we evaluate the performance of cDNA\r\n        microarrays using our current laboratory and data-analysis\r\n        protocols and derive a new intensity-dependent approach to\r\n        identifying differentially expressed genes. RNA from 19\r\n        different human cancer cell lines, the Stratagene universal\r\n        reference RNA, and RNA isolated from a tumor specimen were\r\n        assayed in a series of 'self-self' hybridizations on a\r\n        19,200-element cDNA array (containing 9,600 elements\r\n        spotted in duplicate). Statistical analysis of the ratios\r\n        of Cy5/Cy3 fluorescence intensities among this large number\r\n        of distinct samples provides insight into the variation\r\n        inherent in expression ratios extracted from cDNA\r\n        microarrays. We assess reproducibility of array experiments\r\n        by analyzing replicates, using both clones spotted in\r\n        duplicate on the same array and in triplicate hybridization\r\n        assays. In addition, we use the methodology developed in\r\n        this study to compare expression in a colon and an ovarian\r\n        cell line to identify tissue-specific genes.\r\n        Self-self hybridization results for individual cell\r\n        lines were also analyzed to determine the composition of an\r\n        optimal reference pool consisting of RNA derived from cell\r\n        lines. Our underlying hypothesis was that pooling a large\r\n        number of cell lines might not necessarily improve the\r\n        overall gene representation. Although some cell lines\r\n        express significantly more genes than others, not all cell\r\n        lines express all genes at the same levels. Consequently,\r\n        mixing cell lines may dilute rare transcripts so that their\r\n        representation in the final RNA pool is below the\r\n        detectable limit. Results of our analysis will aid in the\r\n        future assessment of gene-expression patterns and the\r\n        design of reference RNA samples.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Results and discussion\r\n        \r\n          Cell line self-self hybridizations\r\n          To evaluate the natural variability present in spotted\r\n          cDNA microarray data across a number of distinct RNA\r\n          samples, we carried out a set of self-self assays in\r\n          which aliquots of the same RNA are separately labeled\r\n          with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes and co-hybridized to a single\r\n          microarray. Poly(A) +RNA was prepared from 19 human\r\n          carcinoma cell lines (2 brain, 5 colon, 10 ovarian, 1\r\n          pancreatic, and 1 testicular) and Stratagene's universal\r\n          human reference RNA. RNA was reverse transcribed into\r\n          cDNA using random hexamer primers in the presence of\r\n          5-aminoallyl-dUTP; Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were covalently\r\n          coupled to the incorporated aminoallyl linkers in a\r\n          subsequent labeling reaction.\r\n          For each cell line, Cy3- and Cy5-cDNA samples were\r\n          co-hybridized to a spotted microarray containing 19,200\r\n          human cDNA clones (9,600 clones printed in duplicate).\r\n          Hybridization results were analyzed to determine relative\r\n          expression levels for each printed element, and\r\n          hybridization intensity data were first normalized\r\n          globally using an iterative mean-log \r\n          2 (ratio)-centering approach. Briefly,\r\n          log \r\n          2 (ratio) values were calculated for\r\n          each array element and the mean of the distribution was\r\n          calculated. Ratios were adjusted such that the mean log \r\n          2 (ratio) for the entire collection of\r\n          genes was set to zero (or a corresponding average ratio\r\n          of 1). As outliers can significantly influence this\r\n          process, these were identified and excluded and the\r\n          process repeated until convergence. This process results\r\n          in an average Cy5/Cy3 log \r\n          2 (ratio) of zero for the spots\r\n          analyzed in each microarray.\r\n          We and others have noted that the log \r\n          2 (ratio) values often have a\r\n          systematic dependence on intensity most often observed as\r\n          a deviation from zero for low-intensity spots. Locally\r\n          weighted linear regression (lowess) [ 6] has been\r\n          proposed as a normalization method for microarray assays\r\n          [ 7, 8] that can remove intensity-dependent dye-specific\r\n          effects in the log \r\n          2 (ratio) values.\r\n          In this procedure, fluorescence intensities are\r\n          measured from both channels for all elements on the array\r\n          and the log \r\n          2 (Cy5/Cy3) ratios for each spot are\r\n          represented as a function of the log \r\n          10 (Cy5*Cy3) product intensities.\r\n          Scatter-plots of such data, referred to as an 'R-I plot'\r\n          (for ratio-intensity), can reveal intensity-specific\r\n          artifacts in the measurement of the ratio, which tend to\r\n          occur most notably for weakly fluorescing arrayed\r\n          elements. For a self-self hybridization of the type\r\n          analyzed here, one expects a mean log \r\n          2 (Cy5/Cy3) ratio of zero for each\r\n          element in the array independent of intensity. Lowess\r\n          enables deviations from this expected behavior to be\r\n          detected and corrected by performing a local weighted\r\n          linear regression for each data point in the R-I plot and\r\n          subtracting the average ratio from the experimentally\r\n          observed ratio. A representative R-I plot for the cell\r\n          line KM12L4A in Figure 1shows a slight upward curve of\r\n          the log \r\n          2 (ratio) for low-intensity data\r\n          points (shown in blue) which is removed after application\r\n          of the lowess correction, producing a balanced\r\n          distribution of expression ratios around zero independent\r\n          of intensity (shown in red). Similar plots, including a\r\n          calculated standard deviation (SD) both before and after\r\n          lowess correction, are shown in Figure 1c. The most\r\n          important feature of the data is the narrow distribution\r\n          of ratios in individual array experiments regardless of\r\n          the RNA sample assayed in each experiment. This is also\r\n          true of the entire dataset, as can be seen in the\r\n          histogram of combined expression ratios from 30\r\n          experiments, shown in Figure 2.\r\n          These results are comparable to those obtained in a\r\n          recent study of 30 self-self hybridizations on\r\n          10,000-element cDNA arrays [ 9]. Yue \r\n          et al. [ 9] created histograms for\r\n          three sets of data, each consisting of 10 independent\r\n          array experiments, using mRNA derived from human\r\n          placenta, brain and heart tissue. In one of their data\r\n          sets, a 2-SD limit of 1.25-fold was observed; combined,\r\n          99.5% of the data points were within ? 1.4-fold. A small\r\n          number of distinct samples (3) in combination with a\r\n          large number of replicates per sample (10) most probably\r\n          accounts for the slightly tighter distribution of\r\n          expression ratios than that observed in our study.\r\n          The second important aspect of our dataset is the\r\n          number of 'outliers'; approximately 5% of the data points\r\n          in each array fall outside of 2 SD from the mean (data\r\n          not shown). While this is not unexpected, it suggests\r\n          that the distribution of log \r\n          2 (ratio) values does not deviate\r\n          badly from normal. This is of a particular significance\r\n          because it should enable detection of genes with low\r\n          levels of differential expression at high confidence in\r\n          future studies. Combining all data from all 30\r\n          hybridizations, the 2-SD limit is equivalent to 1.46-fold\r\n          change (? 0.546 log \r\n          2 (ratio)), only 18,221 out of 332,601\r\n          points, or 5.5% of the expression ratios, fall outside a\r\n          2-SD threshold. Consequently, if differential expression\r\n          is defined as greater than 2 SD from the mean, genes with\r\n          fold changes greater than 1.5 can be classified as up- or\r\n          down-regulated at approximately 95% confidence level.\r\n          Good-quality array data can only be generated using\r\n          well developed and extensively tested laboratory and\r\n          data-analysis protocols. Our group has been working\r\n          continuously to improve our laboratory procedures and\r\n          implement new data-analysis methods. One of the changes\r\n          recently adopted by ours and many other laboratories is\r\n          indirect cDNA labeling. As first-strand cDNA synthesis is\r\n          identical for both samples, incorporation of nucleotides\r\n          with an aminoallyl linker followed by the covalent\r\n          coupling reaction to Cy dyes reduces bias for\r\n          incorporation of one dye over the other by the reverse\r\n          transcriptase. Slight dye-specific effects are present in\r\n          normalized low-intensity data, probably caused by a\r\n          wavelength-dependent differential response of the\r\n          photomultiplier tubes in the array scanners or slight\r\n          differences or nonlinearities in the quantum efficiencies\r\n          of the fluorescent dyes, but these can be efficiently\r\n          removed by the application of the lowess correction.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Tissue sample self-self hybridization\r\n          In our experience, hybridization using RNA derived\r\n          from tissue samples is generally more problematic than\r\n          that derived from cell lines. To determine whether data\r\n          of comparable quality can be generated with tissue RNA,\r\n          we carried out a similar expression analysis using RNA\r\n          derived from a colon tumor liver metastasis. Twenty\r\n          micrograms of total RNA that have been extracted using\r\n          Trizol and subjected to secondary purification using\r\n          Qiagen RNeasy columns were labeled with both Cy3 and Cy5\r\n          and examined in a self-self co-hybridization assay. The\r\n          distribution of expression ratios is in excellent\r\n          agreement with cell-line data; only 507 out of 11,743\r\n          (4.3%) of identified spots fall outside the 1.42-fold\r\n          change, 2-SD limit.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Intensity-dependent estimation of differential\r\n          expression\r\n          While lowess normalization greatly reduces\r\n          dye-specific artifacts that often appear for\r\n          low-intensity data points, the data exhibit additional\r\n          structure that can be used to evaluate patterns of gene\r\n          expression. As can be seen in Figure 1a, the log \r\n          2 (ratio) measures generally show\r\n          greater variation at lower intensities. Most published\r\n          microarray studies use a single log \r\n          2 (ratio) threshold as a measure of\r\n          differential expression. Examination of the distribution\r\n          in Figure 1suggests that this may inappropriately\r\n          identify genes at intensities where the natural variation\r\n          in the data would not support their selection, while at\r\n          the same time causing genes to be missed in other\r\n          intensities where the data suggest that much lower log \r\n          2 (ratio) values are statistically\r\n          significant. Several mathematical models have been\r\n          derived to explain this phenomenon [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\r\n          One [ 10] discusses the use of a smoothed estimate of the\r\n          SD as a function of the fluorescence intensity. The study\r\n          conducted by Hughes \r\n          et al. [ 11] shows how their model\r\n          for estimating intensity-dependent differential\r\n          expression can be used to identify biologically\r\n          meaningful differential regulation at levels lower than\r\n          twofold in a compendium of 300 different \r\n          Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants\r\n          and chemical treatments.\r\n          We developed a much simpler approach to identify\r\n          differentially expressed genes using an\r\n          intensity-dependent calculation of a standard \r\n          Z -score. Using a sliding window of\r\n          fixed width in log \r\n          10 (Cy5*Cy3), the local mean and SD\r\n          was calculated for each gene using the data in the\r\n          normalized R-I plot. Figure 3adepicts the result of such\r\n          a calculation for the cell line KM12L4A, with data less\r\n          than 1 SD shown blue, between 1SD and 2SD in green, and\r\n          greater than 2 SD in red, respectively; genes greater\r\n          than 2 SD from the local mean ( \r\n          Z > 2) are identified as being\r\n          significantly differentially expressed.\r\n          The shape of the R-I plot and the \r\n          Z -score distributions are\r\n          characteristic of the samples being compared in the\r\n          microarray assay under consideration. For closely related\r\n          samples, such as RNA from a cell line and the same line\r\n          perturbed with a stressor, the R-I distribution has a\r\n          'tadpole' shape similar to that shown for our self-self\r\n          hybridization, although typically with a slightly broader\r\n          distribution in the log \r\n          2 (ratio) than that shown in Figure\r\n          3a. When two very different samples or tissues are\r\n          compared, however, the distribution generally has a\r\n          characteristic 'eye' shape, with the greatest spread\r\n          coming at intermediate expression levels. Figure 3bshows\r\n          the results from a hybridization comparing the CaC02\r\n          (colon) and PA-1 (ovary) cell lines.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Analysis of replicates\r\n          Expression data for clones spotted in duplicate were\r\n          examined to assess reproducibility within each array.\r\n          Plots of the log \r\n          2 -transformed ratios of the Cy5 and\r\n          Cy3 intensities for the two replicates were generated for\r\n          this purpose. As can be seen in the representative plot\r\n          in Figure 4a(blue), log \r\n          2 (Cy5/Cy3) values form a 'sphere'\r\n          centered around zero with the majority of data points\r\n          lying between - 0.5 and + 0.5 on both axes. However, a\r\n          small number of outliers is present and probably\r\n          represent situations where one or both of the replica\r\n          spots are of poor quality. Similar plots were obtained\r\n          for the other 29 self-self hybridization assays (data not\r\n          shown).\r\n          Because one cannot determine \r\n          a priori which of the duplicates is\r\n          in error, irreproducible elements should be removed\r\n          before any further analysis, unless many more replicates\r\n          are analyzed. The idea of outlier filtering was also\r\n          incorporated into the model for the intensity-dependence\r\n          of expression ratios introduced by Baggerly \r\n          et al. [ 10]; we developed a simple\r\n          approach to flag and eliminate questionable replicates.\r\n          Ideally, Cy5/Cy3 ratios should be the same for the two\r\n          replicas and log \r\n          2 (r \r\n          1 /r \r\n          2 ) (where r \r\n          1 and r \r\n          2 are Cy5/Cy3 ratios for the two\r\n          replicas) should be equal to zero; replicates where this\r\n          condition is not satisfied probably contain one or more\r\n          bad elements. Consequently, we sought to filter out genes\r\n          whose log \r\n          2 (r \r\n          1 /r \r\n          2 ) deviates greatly from this\r\n          expected value of zero. We calculated the mean and SD of\r\n          this log \r\n          2 (r \r\n          1 /r \r\n          2 ) for each pair of replicas in the\r\n          entire array, and eliminated pairs of elements whose log \r\n          2 (r \r\n          1 /r \r\n          2 ) is greater than 2 SD from the\r\n          mean. In Figure 4a, 6.3% of data points were eliminated\r\n          using this outlier criterion (red), resulting in a much\r\n          tighter dataset.\r\n          We also examined duplicate clone filtering in a\r\n          hybridization assay of two different samples, CaCO2 and\r\n          PA-1 (Figure 4b). In the case of differential expression,\r\n          the correlation of the replica ratios is expected to be\r\n          linear. The correlation increases from r = 0.86 (blue;\r\n          dashed line) to r = 0.95 (red; solid line) after 1.7% of\r\n          outliers are filtered out using the method outlined\r\n          above. The substantial increase in the correlation\r\n          coefficient suggests that our filtering procedure\r\n          efficiently removes elements with at least one unreliable\r\n          log \r\n          2 (Cy5/Cy3) value.\r\n          A similar approach can be used to identify\r\n          questionable replicate spots on separate slides. To show\r\n          this, five cell lines (CaOV3, HCT-116, KM12L4A, NT2/D1,\r\n          and SW480) were selected and assayed in triplicate. In\r\n          addition, expression in CaCO2 and PA-1 was compared in\r\n          triplicate hybridizations. RNA from the same isolation\r\n          was used for replicate hybridizations, thus allowing us\r\n          to concentrate on technical and not biological\r\n          replication and to explore more thoroughly the systematic\r\n          errors that can arise. Replicate slides were subject to\r\n          filtering in pairs (arrays 1 and 2; 2 and 3; 1 and 3)\r\n          using a process analogous to that applied to within-slide\r\n          replicates; representative data are shown in Figure 5.\r\n          Correlations of log \r\n          2 (Cy5/Cy3) values for the three pairs\r\n          of arrays before (blue; dashed line) and after (red;\r\n          solid line) filtering for the CaOV3 cell line self-self\r\n          hybridizations are shown in Figure 5a. The same set of\r\n          plots for differential expression assays of CaCO2 and\r\n          PA-1 cell lines including linear fits to the data is\r\n          shown in Figure 5b.\r\n          Triplicate hybridization assays enable us to assess\r\n          variability among independent labeling reactions and\r\n          hybridizations. As can be seen in Figure 5a, there is\r\n          some variation in correlations for each pair of\r\n          hybridization replicas (arrays 1 and 2, as well as 2 and\r\n          3, show better correlation than do arrays 1 and 3). When\r\n          averaged over three pairs of replicas, however, the\r\n          variability between arrays is comparable to within-array\r\n          variation. Similar results were obtained for the\r\n          remaining four cell lines (data not shown). For the case\r\n          of hybridizations of two different samples (Figure 5b),\r\n          the mean r values increase significantly from 0.83 (blue;\r\n          dashed lines) to 0.94 (red; solid lines) after outliers\r\n          in each pair of hybridizations are filtered out. These\r\n          correlations are, as in the case of self-self\r\n          hybridizations, similar to those seen for within-array\r\n          replicas.\r\n          Our analysis suggests that replication is essential\r\n          for ensuring data quality, whether spotting replicate\r\n          clones on single arrays or performing multiple\r\n          independent hybridization assays. Further, the replicate\r\n          filtering process we describe here is a simple approach\r\n          that can eliminate questionable array elements and\r\n          provide higher-confidence expression measurements.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Identification of differentially expressed\r\n          genes\r\n          To show how the concepts presented in this study can\r\n          be applied to detect differentially regulated genes, we\r\n          sought to identify sets of genes that are over- and\r\n          under-expressed in ovary relative to colon by analyzing\r\n          hybridization assays of CaCO2 (colon) and PA-1 (ovary)\r\n          cell lines. The CaCO2 sample was labeled with Cy3 and the\r\n          PA-1 sample was labeled with Cy5; genes that are\r\n          expressed in colon at much higher levels will, therefore,\r\n          have negative log-ratios and ovary genes will have\r\n          positive log-ratios.\r\n          For this analysis, we applied the process outlined in\r\n          the previous discussion as follows. First, individual\r\n          arrays were normalized using mean-log-centering and\r\n          lowess procedures (as outlined in the Cell line self-self\r\n          hybridizations section). Next, unreliable spots among\r\n          triplicate arrays were eliminated using the filtering\r\n          approach discussed in the Analysis of replicates section.\r\n          Then, intensity-dependent SDs on the log \r\n          2 (ratio) were computed for each\r\n          array, as described in the Intensity-dependent estimation\r\n          of differential expression section. Array elements with\r\n          ratios outside the 2-SD limit were defined as\r\n          differentially regulated; 510, 543 and 523 were\r\n          identified in each individual assay. Finally, the\r\n          intersection of differentially expressed genes on all\r\n          three arrays was taken; this resulted in a list of 324\r\n          array elements (225 genes, as some are within-array\r\n          replicates), of which 157 (109 genes) have higher\r\n          expression in colon and 167 (116 genes) are more highly\r\n          expressed in the ovary relative to colon.\r\n          A list of differentially expressed genes with mean log\r\n          \r\n          2 (Cy5/Cy3) values and SD calculated\r\n          over three experiments is available (see Additional data\r\n          files). The small SDs illustrate the reproducibility of\r\n          measurements made using the methods described here and\r\n          show their ability to provide a high-confidence list of\r\n          differentially expressed genes and their expression\r\n          ratios.\r\n          In an attempt to validate the differential expression\r\n          we observed in this assay, we compared our results to the\r\n          expression patterns derived from EST libraries generated\r\n          from 18 colon and 12 ovarian sources (including normal\r\n          tissue, cancer tissue, and cell lines) using the digital\r\n          differential display (DDD) available at the National\r\n          Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [ 15] (see\r\n          Additional data files). Although these data sets are not\r\n          completely complementary, we identified one gene that is\r\n          significantly upregulated in the colon relative to ovary\r\n          ( \r\n          PLAB , coding for prostate\r\n          differentiation factor; Hs.296638; THC888554), and one\r\n          gene that is overexpressed in the ovary relative to colon\r\n          (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase; \r\n          DHCR24; Hs.75616; THC932478) in\r\n          both microarray and DDD data. We also identified three\r\n          gene families significantly differentially expressed in\r\n          both datasets. We found genes in the solute carrier\r\n          families 34 (Hs.84700; DDD), 22 (THC960422; microarray)\r\n          and 16 (THC863879; microarray), as well as laminin A5\r\n          (Hs.11669; DDD) and A4 (THC933239; microarray) to be more\r\n          abundant in the ovary. In addition, serologically defined\r\n          colon cancer antigens 28 (Hs.84700; DDD) and 33\r\n          (THC899239; microarray) were more highly represented in\r\n          colon. However, we also found two discrepancies in\r\n          relative abundances of one gene and one gene family\r\n          between the DDD and microarray data. DDD data indicate\r\n          that the protein-kinase inhibitor P58 (Hs.177574;\r\n          THC906738) is more abundant in the ovary but the same\r\n          gene appears to be more highly represented in the colon\r\n          in our microarray study. Similarly, insulin-like growth\r\n          factor binding protein 3 (Hs.77326; DDD) is upregulated\r\n          in the ovary relative to colon while the opposite is true\r\n          for insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6\r\n          (THC1022140; microarray).\r\n          To further validate our findings, we performed\r\n          quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)\r\n          assays on 25 genes with log \r\n          10 (R*G) and log \r\n          2 (R/G) values encompassing the entire\r\n          range present in the microarray data. Expression ratios\r\n          obtained by quantitative RT-PCR (see Additional data\r\n          files), are in good agreement with the ratios obtained\r\n          using microarrays. This concordance is especially\r\n          significant for genes with low expression ratios and for\r\n          transcripts expressed at low copy number, confirming the\r\n          validity of our approach for obtaining a high-confidence\r\n          list of differentially expressed genes. RT-PCR data also\r\n          showed that the P58 protein-kinase inhibitor (Hs.177574;\r\n          THC906738) is upregulated in the colon relative to ovary,\r\n          which supports our array results and suggests that the\r\n          discrepancy between microarrays and DDD is not due to\r\n          technical limitations of microarray assays but reflects a\r\n          true biological difference between the cell lines we\r\n          compared and tissues used in DDD.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Reference pool selection\r\n          Comparison of query samples to a common reference\r\n          sample is among the most widely used experimental designs\r\n          for large-scale microarray studies [ 16, 17]. Reference\r\n          samples often consist of pools of RNA molecules derived\r\n          from cell lines because cell lines provide a renewable\r\n          source of large quantities of RNA. Each cell line\r\n          expresses a distinct assortment of RNA species, so any\r\n          particular cell line will provide measurable, baseline\r\n          hybridization for only a subset of the genes on an array.\r\n          Consequently, cell line RNA reference pools are typically\r\n          constructed from a large number (10 or more) of cell\r\n          lines derived from a variety of primary tissues. The idea\r\n          underlying such a design is that by combining RNAs from\r\n          diverse cell lines, one might obtain a more complete\r\n          representation of the genes spotted on the array.\r\n          This approach, however, does not take into account the\r\n          expression levels of individual genes in each cell line.\r\n          While genes expressed at high levels will give detectable\r\n          signal even when diluted by a factor of 10, many of the\r\n          more rare transcripts may get diluted to below the\r\n          detection limit. Therefore, we hypothesized that\r\n          comparable or better representation of spotted genes\r\n          might be obtained using fewer cell lines, each expressing\r\n          a large number of diverse genes. To test this hypothesis,\r\n          we constructed two reference pools, TP-1 and TP-2, using\r\n          a naive gene-counting approach designed to include three\r\n          cell lines with the greatest representation of unique\r\n          genes that are also easy to grow and yield high\r\n          quantities of RNA. TP-1 consists of colon cell lines\r\n          CaCO2 and KM12L4A as well as the ovarian cell line\r\n          OVCAR3; OVCAR3 is replaced with the U118MG (brain) cell\r\n          line in TP-2.\r\n          The results of our analysis are summarized in Figure\r\n          6, which shows a histogram representing the percentage of\r\n          array elements with signals in both Cy3 and Cy5 channels\r\n          in self-self hybridizations. The performance of TP-1 is\r\n          comparable to that of the Stratagene pool (approximately\r\n          75%), despite a large difference in the number of cell\r\n          lines in each pool. This supports our hypothesis that\r\n          adding more cell lines to the pool may not necessarily\r\n          improve the overall gene representation because some\r\n          genes are diluted below the detection limit.\r\n          Including cell lines from very dissimilar tissues may,\r\n          however, give a better representation of the genes on the\r\n          array. TP-2 contains a brain instead of an ovarian cell\r\n          line and covers close to 80% of the spotted sequences.\r\n          This improved performance relative to TP-1 is likely to\r\n          be due both to the fact that brain exhibits the greatest\r\n          diversity of transcripts (on the basis of based EST and\r\n          serial analysis of gene expression, SAGE, analysis), and\r\n          that the subset of genes expressed in brain is more\r\n          disjoint with the genes observed in colon than in ovary.\r\n          This illustrates that a simple pool of RNA from diverse\r\n          cell lines can provide a superior reference.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Conclusion\r\n        DNA microarray assays performed using well optimized\r\n        laboratory protocols can produce high-quality, reproducible\r\n        data, although the use of replicates, particularly\r\n        dye-reversal, or 'flip-dye' assays, are highly desirable.\r\n        While global normalization of the data can help to provide\r\n        meaningful expression ratios, a more sophisticated\r\n        normalization using lowess allows for correction of\r\n        intensity-dependent artifacts in the data. Together, the\r\n        laboratory and analytical techniques described here can\r\n        produce highly precise and accurate data. In the 30 assays\r\n        we performed, the global 2-SD limit corresponded to an\r\n        expression ratio between ? 1.33-fold and ? 1.62-fold\r\n        induction or repression, with a mean of ? 1.47\r\n        (corresponding to log \r\n        2 (ratio) values of ? 0.41, ? 0.70, and\r\n        ? 0.56, respectively), with fewer than 5% of the data\r\n        points falling outside the 2 SD limit. This suggests that\r\n        changes in gene expression smaller than the ? 2-fold\r\n        commonly used can be reliably identified as differential\r\n        expression. More careful analysis of the distribution of\r\n        ratios as a function of intensity suggests that an\r\n        intensity-dependent assessment of local SD of the\r\n        distribution provides a better measure of statistically\r\n        significant differential expression; essentially\r\n        calculating a local \r\n        Z -score. The same holds true for\r\n        tissue RNA from tumor samples. Individual labeling\r\n        reactions and hybridizations do not introduce significant\r\n        variability, as judged from good correlations of replicate\r\n        experiments. However, a small number of outliers present in\r\n        replicate spots and/or arrays can be filtered out,\r\n        underlining the importance of replicates in generating\r\n        high-quality expression data.\r\n        Pooled reference samples should be designed on the basis\r\n        not only of representation of individual genes in each cell\r\n        line but also of expression levels of genes within the cell\r\n        lines. Adding more cell lines to the pool does not\r\n        necessarily improve overall gene representation because\r\n        rare transcripts become undetectable when diluted in a pool\r\n        of a large number of cell lines.\r\n        Overall, the data presented herein, derived from a large\r\n        number of RNA samples from cell lines and tissue, suggest\r\n        that the laboratory and data analysis protocols we describe\r\n        should allow for a more accurate and reproducible\r\n        identification of differentially expressed genes than does\r\n        the selection of an arbitrary, global fold-change threshold\r\n        chosen independent of any measure of the natural\r\n        variability in the data. We propose a model for analysis of\r\n        cDNA microarray data consisting of three steps:\r\n        lowess-normalization of individual arrays, followed by\r\n        replica filtering to remove questionable elements, and\r\n        finally estimation of the local \r\n        Z -score for identification of\r\n        differentially regulated genes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Materials and methods\r\n        \r\n          Array fabrication\r\n          cDNA clones were obtained from the Research Genetics\r\n          sequence-verified human cDNA collection. Clone inserts\r\n          were PCR-amplified directly from culture and purified\r\n          according to a previously published protocol [ 5, 18].\r\n          PCR from plasmid miniprep DNA was carried out for\r\n          microtiter plates that had fewer than 85% single-band PCR\r\n          products when amplified from culture. The overall success\r\n          rate for single-band amplification was 88%. Clones were\r\n          printed in duplicate from 50% DMSO onto SuperAmine slides\r\n          (Telechem International) as described previously and\r\n          cross-linked at 90 mJ using a Stratalinker\r\n          (Stratagene).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          RNA extraction\r\n          Cells were grown in a tissue culture incubator (37?C,\r\n          5% CO \r\n          2 ) in RPMI 1640 or DMEM medium (Life\r\n          Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,\r\n          200 ?g/ml streptomycin and 200 U/ml penicillin. RNA was\r\n          extracted with Trizol (Life Technologies) according to\r\n          the manufacturer's protocol and stored at -80?C. mRNA\r\n          selection from 100 ?g total RNA using oligo-d(T) \r\n          25 Dynabeads (Dynal) and following the\r\n          manufacturer's directions yielded 2-3 ?g poly(A)\r\n          +-enriched RNA in 20 ?l 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Agilent\r\n          2100 Bioanalyzer mRNA assays were carried out on 1-?l\r\n          aliquots and ribosomal contamination was estimated to\r\n          vary between 0 and 25%. The rest of the mRNA sample was\r\n          used to prepare fluorescently labeled cDNA probes.\r\n          RNA from a colon tumor liver metastasis was extracted\r\n          with Trizol (Life Technologies) and further purified on\r\n          RNeasy columns (Qiagen) using the protocol supplied by\r\n          the manufacturers. For each labeling reaction, 20 ?g\r\n          total RNA were used.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Probe preparation\r\n          First-strand cDNA synthesis was primed with 4 ?g of\r\n          random nonamers (New England Biolabs) or 6 ?g random\r\n          hexamers (Life Technologies) by heating at 70?C for 10\r\n          minutes, snap-cooling in dry ice/ethanol for 30 sec, and\r\n          incubating at room temperature for an additional 5-10\r\n          min. Reverse transcription was performed in the presence\r\n          of 500 ?M each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 200 ?M\r\n          5-aminoallyl-dUTP (Sigma), 300 ?M dTTP, 1 ? first-strand\r\n          buffer, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 400 U Superscript II\r\n          (Life Technologies) in 40-?l reactions at 42?C for 3 h to\r\n          overnight. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 10\r\n          ?l of 0.5 M EDTA and RNA template was hydrolyzed by the\r\n          addition of 10 ?l of 1 M NaOH followed by heating at 70?C\r\n          for 10 min. Reactions were neutralized with 10 ?l of 1 M\r\n          HCl, and cDNA was purified on QIAquick columns (Qiagen)\r\n          according to the manufacturer's directions but\r\n          substituting phosphate wash buffer (5 mM potassium\r\n          phosphate pH 8.0, 80% ethanol) for buffer PE, and\r\n          phosphate elution buffer (4 mM potassium phosphate pH\r\n          8.5) for buffer EB.\r\n          cDNA was lyophilized to dryness and resuspended in 4.5\r\n          ?l of 0.1 M sodium carbonate pH 9.0 buffer. NHS ester\r\n          (4.5 ?l) of Cy3 or Cy5 dye (Amersham Pharmacia) in DMSO\r\n          (dye from one tube was dissolved in 72 ?l of DMSO) were\r\n          added and reactions were incubated at room temperature in\r\n          the dark for 1 h. Coupling reactions were quenched by the\r\n          addition of 41 ?l of 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, and\r\n          unincorporated dye was removed using QIAquick columns.\r\n          Labeling efficiency was determined by analyzing the whole\r\n          undiluted sample in a spectrophotometer using a 50-?L\r\n          MicroCuvette (Beckman). Total incorporated Cy dye ranged\r\n          from 300-600 pmol and the ratio of unlabeled to labeled\r\n          nucleotides was typically between 25 and 50.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Hybridization and image processing\r\n          Slides were prehybridized in 1.0% BSA, 5 ?

SSC, 0.1% SDS). To combined Cy3 and Cy5 samples were\r\n          added 20 ?g Cot1 DNA and 20 ?g poly(A) +DNA and samples\r\n          were denatured at 95?C for 5 min, followed by snap\r\n          cooling on ice for 1 min. Room-temperature probes were\r\n          applied to a prehybridized array, covered with a glass\r\n          coverslip (Fisher), and placed in a humidified\r\n          hybridization chamber (Corning). Hybridizations were\r\n          carried out at 42?C for 16-20 h, followed by washing in\r\n          (5 min each): 1 ? SSC and 0.2% SDS at 42?C once, 0.1 ?\r\n          SSC and 0.2% SDS at room temperature once, and 0.1 ? SSC\r\n          at room temperature twice. Arrays were scanned using a\r\n          GenePix 4000 dual-color confocal laser scanner (Axon).\r\n          Data were collected in Cy3 and Cy5 channels and stored as\r\n          paired TIFF images.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Data analysis\r\n          Spots were identified and local background subtracted\r\n          in the TIGR_Spotfinder software [ 19]. In the first step,\r\n          a grid consisting of square cells is drawn around each\r\n          array element. Spot segmentation is then performed using\r\n          a histogram segmentation method that uses the\r\n          distribution of pixel intensities to separate probable\r\n          signal from background and a binary thresholding approach\r\n          to identify spots, followed by a procedure to exclude\r\n          disconnected features. Raw intensity for each element is\r\n          obtained by first excluding saturated pixels and then\r\n          summing all remaining pixel intensities inside the spot\r\n          contour. The area outside the spot contour but inside the\r\n          cell is used to calculate local background. Background\r\n          per pixel is estimated as a median of the pixels in this\r\n          area and is multiplied by the spot area to give an\r\n          estimated spot background value. In the final step, this\r\n          integrated background value is subtracted from the raw\r\n          integrated spot intensity to produce the\r\n          background-subtracted integrated intensities we use for\r\n          further analysis. Furthermore, a quality control (QC)\r\n          filter is used to remove questionable array features. Two\r\n          criteria for spot rejection are a spot shape that\r\n          deviates greatly from a circle and low signal-to-noise\r\n          ratio. Spots for which the ratio of area to circumference\r\n          deviates by more than 20% from the value for an ideal\r\n          circle and spots containing fewer than 50% of pixels\r\n          above the median background value are flagged and\r\n          eliminated from further consideration. This approach has\r\n          proved extremely robust to misidentification of the spot\r\n          boundaries, and expression measures have shown it to be\r\n          both reproducible and verifiable. The output data from\r\n          Spotfinder is available as additional data files.\r\n          Lowess normalization was implemented using a native\r\n          Java implementation in TIGR MIDAS (Microarray Data\r\n          Analysis System), freely available through [ 19] and\r\n          based on the LOCFIT package developed by Bell Labs [ 20].\r\n          For all normalization, the smoothing parameter was set to\r\n          33%. All additional data files and protocols used in this\r\n          study are available from [ 21].\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Quantitative real-time RT-PCR\r\n          Quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed on the ABI\r\n          Prism 7900HT sequence-detection system using the Taqman\r\n          Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) and\r\n          QuantiTech SYBRGreen PCR Kit (Qiagen) using a two-step\r\n          reaction with protocols supplied by manufacturers.\r\n          Primers were designed in the Primer 3 Old Version [ 22]\r\n          using default parameters with minor modifications\r\n          (product size range 100-150; optimum T \r\n          m 60; minimum T \r\n          m 58; maximum T \r\n          m 61; maximum 3' complementarity 1).\r\n          Following the initial RT, 1 ?l of the resulting reaction\r\n          product amplified by PCR in a 20 ?l reaction volume with\r\n          200 nM final primer concentration.
