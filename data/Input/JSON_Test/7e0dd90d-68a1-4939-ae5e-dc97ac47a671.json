Its worldview is cranky and at times\r\nirresponsible. Its subject is a busybody. And yet these books are a real\r\nachievement. They leave no doubt that Eleanor deserves a William Manchester to\r\nher Winston Churchill or, for that matter, a Frank Freidel to her FDR.\r\n\r\n            A recap: Eleanor Roosevelt is born in 1884, orphaned early. Her mother lives\r\njust long enough to inculcate in her (unjustifiably) a sense of her own\r\nawkwardness. Her beloved father, Elliott Roosevelt, is a kind-hearted drunk who\r\ndies at 34, hounded to the grave by a sadistic and mentally warped elder\r\nbrother, who (perhaps smarting at having been outshone by Elliott in his youth)\r\nslanders him in public, fleeces him out of his money, turns his family against\r\nhim, and seeks to get him institutionalized. That brother, Teddy, becomes\r\npresident in 1901. (OK ... so that's more my opinion than Cook's.)\r\n\r\n            Eleanor attends Allenswood, Marie Souvestre's radical girls' school in\r\nEngland, a vaguely Sapphic environment where she learns four languages and much\r\npoetry, and blossoms. No room for that back in the States, once she marries her\r\ncousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Eleanor comes under the thumb of her\r\npassive-aggressive mother-in-law Sara (Nurse Ratched-cum-Martha Stewart), who\r\nuses the family finances to stay Top Woman in her son's life.\r\n\r\n            FDR is bound for glory: New York state senator, assistant secretary of the\r\nNavy 1913-1921, vice presidential nominee 1920, New York governor 1929-32, then\r\npresident to 1945. He's also, in Cook's nice phrase \"a flirt, a bottom-pincher,\r\nand a knee-holder.\" When ER discovers love letters from Lucy Mercer while\r\nunpacking his trunk, she offers him his \"freedom.\" If that's a euphemism for\r\ndivorce, he declines. If it means freedom tout court , he accepts.\r\n\r\n            So does she. And in a strange way, after an initial frost, their marriage\r\ngrows more tender as it grows more distant. (Let's talk more about this.) He\r\nveers into the man's world of Albany, Washington and, once he's stricken with\r\npolio, the spa he starts in Warm Springs, Ga. She becomes a woman's\r\nagitator--trade unions, suffrage, Democratic Party backrooms. Cook's bombshell\r\nis her assertion that Eleanor, throughout the White House years, was in a\r\npassionate lesbian relationship with AP reporter Lorena Hickok. \"Hick\" is a\r\ndeeply sympathetic character--from a broken Midwestern home, she knows not only\r\nreal breadline-and-boardinghouse poverty but also opera and poetry. She's\r\nEleanor's Boswell/Eckermann and Cook's eyes and ears.\r\n\r\n            In the White House, Eleanor is too immersed in her life of women's activism\r\nto change. But she adapts so skillfully that no one quite realizes it. She\r\ncontinues with coalition-building, starts a column (\"My Day\"), and grapples\r\nwith America's race problem. Under Hick's influence, she occupies herself with\r\nthe Poor of all sexes. The White House has two social circles, two policy\r\ncircles, two agendas. But while Eleanor's agenda looks\r\nseparatist--women-only press conferences, an attempt to avert World War II\r\nthrough a Lysistrata -style \"women's strike for peace\"--it also succeeds\r\nin grafting onto Roosevelt's coalition new blocs of the\r\nhitherto-disenfranchised without which the New Deal would be impracticable. The\r\nonly shameful note: Eleanor's seeming indifference to the plight of Europe's\r\nJews.\r\n\r\n            This is Whig History for the PC era, full of paeans to same-sex love,\r\nsweeping generalizations about emotional needs, attacks on present-day lack of\r\ncivility, and you-go-girl!-type interjections. Such history brings strengths:\r\nSince Cook's first allegiance is to feminism (more specifically, to gay\r\nrights), she is not dug in on most of the political and economic questions that\r\ndivide FDR's hagiographers from his detractors. She thus shows the elitist,\r\npaternalist (and shallow) roots of Franklin's progressivism, his tendency to\r\ncompromise, the personalism of his program. (I'd make the case that Eleanor had\r\nmore in common with him than it appears.) It also brings weaknesses: This is\r\nradical history, and Cook's description of post-World War I race riots, of the\r\nWobblies' agitation in the 1920s, of mid-1930s anti-communism (which she calls\r\na \"Red Scare\"), could have been written by Earl Browder.\r\n\r\n            Sorry to run on. These are excellent books to be read with extreme caution.\r\nI'm puzzled that Cook at once urges that we study Eleanor in her own right, yet\r\nso \"privileges\" these first five years of her husband's administration. I'm\r\nbothered that Cook uses the old leftist trick of praising her subject's\r\nvisionary radicalism, and then condemning as alarmist fabricators those who\r\nrecognize but don't like it. (A particular paradox: In insisting on Eleanor's\r\nlesbianism as central, she follows the lack of circumspection of ER's\r\ncontemporary detractors , not allies.) I wonder if rich ladies'\r\nself-actualization provides a useful model for legislation to help poor women.\r\nI'm also curious about how Cook would compare Eleanor and Hillary\r\nClinton--since she is constantly inviting 1990s comparisons. But I'm most\r\ncurious about what you think.\r\n\r\n            Best,\r\nChris.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n   \r\n"},"properties":[{"key":"SourceSystemId","values":["C5Y1V5J5T2U4.96R8QL2FBH243@mimefactory.state.tld"]},{"key":"Sender","values":["{\"Name\":null,\"Address\":\"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev\",\"RoutingType\":\"SMTP\",\"MailboxType\":\"Mailbox\",\"Id\":null}"]},{"key":"IngestedFromMailbox","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"BirthId","values":["7e0dd90d-68a1-4939-ae5e-dc97ac47a671"]},{"key":"SizeInKb","values":["11.416"]},{"key":"Sensitivity","values":["Official"]},{"key":"SensitivityAssigned","values":["TransitoryModified"]},{"key":"IsTransitory","values":["True"]},{"key":"AttachmentCount","values":["0"]},{"key":"IsCapstone","values":["False"]},{"key":"IsRecord","values":["True"]},{"key":"Classification","values":[""]},{"key":"MetadataGenerated","values":["2017-11-08T20:46:12.0229488Z"]},{"key":"MetadataGeneratorVersion","values":["0.1.1107.1"]},{"key":"Source","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"SourceType","values":["EmailExchange"]},{"key":"DispositionType","values":["Transitory"]},{"key":"DispositionDate","values":["2018-11-06T23:59:28Z"]}],"security":{"securityDescriptors":["RECORD","OFFICIAL","DS-BUREAU","eRecords"],"signatures":[]},"users":[{"userRoles":["From"],"id":122,"originalSmtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","smtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"firstName":"svcErecMbxPusher","userValidFrom":"2017-04-18T10:34:19.84","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\svcErecMbxPusher","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"svcErecMbxPusher","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7143","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":131,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb36Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb36Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb36Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"eRecJmb36Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7216","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":147,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb4Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb4Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"isDomestic":true,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb4Recip1","bureauPK":15,"bureauCode":"DS","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","division":"DS","samAccountName":"eRecJmb4Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7152","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":172,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb35Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb35Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb35Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"eRecJmb35Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7214","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"}]},"errata":[{"type":"Warning","task":"ParseJournal","field":"JournalReport","value":"","reason":"No Journal Reports for Email"},{"type":"Information","task":"ParseMime","field":"Sensitivity","value":"Transitory","reason":"Modified Sensitivity to Official from Transitory"}],"indexLocation":"email_transitory12mo_2017_w45"}
