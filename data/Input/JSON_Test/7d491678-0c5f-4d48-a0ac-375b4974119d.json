At first the figure\r\nlooks almost cute in his fire engine red suit, but is that a roll of bills in\r\nhis left hand or is he making an obscene gesture? And those hollow black eyes,\r\nscarred hands, and sunken chest--don't they seem just a bit sepulchral? Is he\r\nwelcoming us to Maxim's or to the underworld?\r\n\r\n            For the moment, at\r\nleast, he's guarding the entrance to the stunning show at the Jewish Museum\r\ndevoted to the work of Chaim Soutine (1894-1943), the Lithuanian-born Jewish\r\npainter who worked in Paris between the world wars. This is the first major\r\nexhibition in a New York museum to be devoted to Soutine's work in nearly 50\r\nyears--since, that is, the epoch-making retrospective of 1950 at the Museum of\r\nModern Art. The timing of that show, mounted just seven years after Soutine's\r\ndeath, was in one sense perfect and in another highly problematic. It coincided\r\nexactly with the extraordinary rise of Abstract Expressionism and the seismic\r\nshift of the center of the art world from Paris to New York. Artists and\r\ncritics were eager to see in Soutine a Parisian precursor of Willem de\r\nKooning--who claimed to be \"crazy about Soutine\"--and Jackson Pollock. The\r\nextraordinary landscapes that Soutine painted around 1921 in the provincial\r\ntown of C?ret, with their swirling wreaths of thick paint and decentered\r\nstructure, could easily be mistaken for early de Koonings. (Click here for an example.) \"Was Soutine at this time what might\r\nbe called an abstract expressionist?\" the critic and curator Monroe Wheeler\r\nasked rhetorically in the MoMA catalog.\r\n\r\n            But in other ways, the timing of the MoMA show was awkward\r\nand even potentially embarrassing. As France was welcomed back to the postwar\r\ncommunity of nations, no one felt like asking tough questions about French\r\nacquiescence in the Holocaust. In the 1950 catalog, Wheeler implied that\r\nSoutine's death in 1943 had little to do with the Occupation. \"Soutine,\" he\r\nwrote, \"suffered no specific persecution or violence during the war. In 1940,\r\nhe was offered an opportunity to come to America, but he would not take\r\nadvantage of it. He lived with a friend ... in Touraine.\" And so on. But, as\r\nthe art historian Remy Golan notes in a catalog essay for the current show,\r\n\"after having provided hospitality to Soutine and thousands of Jewish\r\nimmigrants like him for three decades, the French essentially abandoned them to\r\ntheir own fate during the years of German occupation.\" Soutine wasn't just\r\n\"living with a friend\" in the countryside. He was in flight from the Nazis and\r\ntheir French functionaries, hiding and constantly on the move. He returned to\r\nParis only when a severe stomach ulcer condition necessitated a last-minute\r\noperation. It came too late, and he died.\r\n\r\n            So the current show at\r\nthe Jewish Museum offers an opportunity both to re-evaluate Soutine's\r\nconnection to de Kooning and Pollock and to dig more deeply into Soutine's\r\nrelation to French culture and to his own Jewishness. The show is arranged in a\r\nmanner to do just that, though with a resulting wrenching of chronology and\r\nlittle attention to Soutine's life. The 56 paintings in the show are hung in\r\nthree sections, each corresponding to one of the three ways critics have viewed\r\nSoutine: Soutine as an untutored \"primitive\" painter, which is how he was seen\r\nin the 1920s; Soutine as a master and the last great hope for traditional\r\npainting in France--his reputation in the 1930s; and Soutine as a prophet of\r\nAbstract Expressionism, which is what critics thought in the 1940s, when they\r\n\"rediscovered\" him. It is this third phase that leads to the biggest\r\ndislocation in the show, since visitors see the \"abstract\" paintings of the\r\nC?ret period last, though they were among the earliest Soutine painted. The\r\nfirst two phases--from primitive to master--happen to follow pretty much\r\ndirectly from the circumstances of Soutine's life, to the extent that we know\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n            The youthful Soutine seems to step right out of an Isaac\r\nBashevis Singer story. Since he left almost no paper trail--few letters, no\r\ndrawings, no artistic manifestoes--the same stories gleaned from friends and\r\ndealers have been recycled over the years. Soutine was born the 10 th\r\nof 11 children to an impoverished tailor (or more precisely a \"mender\") and his\r\nwife in Smilovitchi, a village near Minsk. Legends about his childhood--of\r\nwhich he may have been the source--include his theft of some kitchen utensils\r\nto buy his first colored pencil, and his early portrait of a local rabbi. The\r\nrabbi's son, evidently responding to the Jewish injunction against graven\r\nimages, beat up Soutine, then paid a reparation of 25 rubles toward Soutine's\r\neducation. Soutine trained first with artists in Minsk and Vilna, then made the\r\njourney to Paris, where he studied briefly in a formal art academy while living\r\nin the most abject poverty.\r\n\r\n            Some of his earliest\r\nstill lifes, dating from 1916 to 1918, look like little parables of\r\ndeprivation: three anorexic herrings on a plate with two forks (why two?)\r\ngroping across them ( Still Life With Herrings , circa 1916). The table is\r\ntipped upward, almost meeting the picture plane. Such paintings, along with the\r\nswirling C?ret landscapes, struck collectors of the 1920s as \"naive,\" just the\r\nsort of unschooled stuff you'd expect from a Slavic child of the shtetl .\r\nThe critic Waldemar George wrote in 1928, \"Is this not the art of an exile, or\r\neven a savage?\" Soutine's big break came in 1922, when one of those\r\nconnoisseurs of the \"primitive,\" the eccentric Philadelphia art educator Dr.\r\nAlbert Barnes, bought up 52 of Soutine's paintings, making Soutine an art world\r\ncelebrity almost overnight.\r\n\r\n            But almost as soon as he had experienced this\r\nCinderella-like reversal of fortune, Soutine developed second thoughts about\r\nhis work up to that point and tried to destroy as much of it as he could get\r\nhis hands on. No longer the wild and visionary improviser, Soutine now\r\napprenticed himself to the great painterly painters of the past: Courbet,\r\nChardin, and Rembrandt. If you preferred his early landscapes, it was easy to\r\nregard this new Soutine as--in the words of Clement Greenberg, who reviewed the\r\nMoMA show--\"a victim of the museum.\" But if you liked the later paintings, as\r\nFrench critics of the '30s tended to do, they seemed like the next step in the\r\ngreat French tradition. Soutine the Slavic-Jewish outsider quickly became\r\nSoutine the quintessential insider, a masterly upholder of the standards of\r\nsophisticated French art.\r\n\r\n            Never\r\nable to paint anything unless he had it before his eyes, Soutine set about\r\nre-enacting some of the classic paintings he loved most. He persuaded peasant\r\nwomen to hike up their skirts and stand in cold streams, just as Rembrandt had\r\ndemanded. He acquired a skate from the fishmonger and painted a loose\r\nparaphrase of a Chardin still life. In imitation of Rembrandt's flayed ox on\r\ndisplay at the Louvre, Soutine hung a carcass of beef in his studio. In a\r\ncarnivalesque reassigning of roles, he hired a model to sweep away the flies\r\nfrom the decaying meat. To keep the colors fresh, he dabbed the carcass with\r\nblood from a pail, then grabbed his paintbrushes to capture those lurid reds on\r\ncanvas. This was the kind of scene that an action painter could relish. De\r\nKooning could have been thinking of his idol Soutine when he observed, \"Flesh\r\nwas the reason why oil painting was invented.\"\r\n\r\n            You'd think Soutine, with his obsessive delight in flesh,\r\nwould paint nudes, but no; he painted only one in his whole career, and it's a\r\nminor painting. But at the same time he was painting his carcasses of cattle\r\nand fowl, around 1925, Soutine painted a series of portraits of uniformed\r\nworkers--bellhops, pastry cooks, grooms--of which the Maxim's page boy is\r\nprobably the best known. This parallel obsession elicited the interesting\r\nsuggestion, from the critic Maurice Tuchman, that both animals (especially\r\nsacrificed animals) and uniformed domestics were scapegoats of sorts. While\r\nSoutine--unlike Chagall, to whom he is sometimes compared--did not paint\r\nstereotypically Jewish subjects, he may have been alluding, with those dangling fowl, to a Yom Kippur rite in which a slaughtered\r\nchicken was whirled around a rabbi's head in a ritual of absolution. It may\r\nalso be worth noting that with their red or white uniforms, these servants\r\nallowed Soutine to retain his lurid, fleshy palate.\r\n\r\n            It has\r\nbeen tempting to see in Soutine's flayed forms a premonition of things to come.\r\nThe curators of the Jewish Museum show, in a volley of questions, invite such a\r\nresponse:\r\n\r\n            Mightn't the eviscerated\r\ncows and the fowl in the throes of death be experienced as modernist mementi\r\nmori, fetishistic reminders of the darkest, cruelest, and most primitive human\r\ninstincts? Couldn't Soutine's eruptive, vertiginous landscapes be construed as\r\nrecollections of a ravaged Europe, or even as the foreshadowing of an\r\napocalyptic, post-atomic future?\r\n\r\n            And so\r\non.\r\n\r\n            The irony is that Soutine seems to have viewed the arrival\r\nof the Nazis, at least initially, with a certain equanimity, more cheerful than\r\nfatalistic. Perhaps he had so thoroughly identified his art at this point with\r\nFrench national traditions--was he not the legitimate heir of Courbet?--that he\r\nhardly imagined himself to be a potential victim. One of his mistresses\r\nrecalled him reading with admiration editorials by the collaborationist\r\nidealogue Charles Maurras, of Action Fran?aise , and explaining that he\r\napproved of social inequality \"because it presented magnificent opportunities\r\nfor everyone.\" One day she said to him, \"You have had great unhappiness in your\r\nlife, haven't you, Soutine?\" He replied, \"No! What makes you think that? I have\r\nalways been a happy man.\"\r\n\r\n            Nonetheless, the image from\r\nhis late work that stays with you is a little picture from the Phillips\r\nCollection called Return From School After the Storm (circa 1939). Here\r\nthe paint is as swirling and thick as in Soutine's earliest landscapes. The two\r\nchildren hold hands fearfully as storm clouds hover ominously above them. The\r\ntwo vulnerable figures are literally molded of paint; the girl's left hand juts\r\nout a quarter-inch from the canvas in one thick dab. The title is not\r\nSoutine's. I don't think it's a school that these children are running from,\r\nand I don't think the storm is behind them.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
