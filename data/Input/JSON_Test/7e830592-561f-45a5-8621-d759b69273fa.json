Today, that army's delinquent stepchild, the Russian army, is\r\nfighting a city battle of its own. The Russians are pounding their own city,\r\nGrozny, to rubble and are murdering Russian civilians in the process. Their\r\nconquest of Grozny, which should conclude by the end of January, will complete\r\na methodical campaign of brutality. Since October, more than 100,000 Russian\r\ntroops have inched through Chechnya, leveling villages with low-precision\r\nartillery and dumb bombs. This \"pacification\" has killed many Chechen\r\nguerrillas and civilians and has turned most of the survivors into refugees.\r\n\"In its indiscriminate use of firepower against civilian targets, it is as bad\r\nas anything since World War II,\" says Lani Kass, a professor of military\r\nstrategy at the National War College.\r\n\r\n            No matter. The war against the Chechens, who are\r\ndespised as Muslim terrorists in slavic Russia, is wildly popular, proof that\r\nRussian military power is returning. Chechnya is payback for Afghanistan, for\r\nthe first humiliating Chechen war of 1994-96, and for NATO's bombing of Serbia.\r\nThe army's triumph will ensure Vladimir Putin's election as president in March.\r\nIt has already restored the military's prestige and budget.\r\n\r\n            But the notion that\r\nChechnya's rape represents a return of Russian military glory is preposterous.\r\nRussia is turtling through Chechnya partly because it doesn't have enough\r\ncompetent troops to fight more quickly. Russia can rely on only about 20,000\r\nskilled soldiers in an army of 700,000. Analysts believe that Russia could\r\nmuster \"one or two\" decent army divisions out of a paper strength of 70\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n            Russia's military is a lumpen -army, the dregs of\r\ndregs. Conscription remains mandatory, but more than 80 percent of young\r\nRussians avoid it. The enlisted ranks fill with the stupid, the sick, and the\r\ncriminal. These soldiers are little better than cannon fodder. Russia makes no\r\nserious effort to train them, because it doesn't have qualified noncommissioned\r\nofficers, and its officers can't control the conscripts. Hazing is unbelievably\r\nbrutal: More than 1,000 soldiers are murdered every year by their\r\nbrothers-in-arms, and more than 500 kill themselves because of the horrific\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n            Pay is laughably small\r\nand usually in arrears. Russia has shelved its longstanding plan to switch to a\r\nvolunteer army because it can't pay enough to recruit soldiers. According to\r\nthe CIA, Russia spends only one-sixth as much on the military as the Soviet\r\nUnion did during the '80s. Clothing and rations are scarce: Navy servicemen\r\nhave starved to death. Alcoholism is rampant, as soldiers drink everything they\r\ncan get their hands on. (In the '80s, the Mig-25 was nicknamed the \"Flying\r\nRestaurant\" because crews would drain and drink its alcohol-based hydraulic\r\nfluid.) Hepatitis flourishes because troops don't know how to dig latrines. The\r\narmy is \"a kingdom of darkness,\" says U.S. Army War College professor Stephen\r\nBlank.\r\n\r\n            Russia can't afford to equip its so-called soldiers. Only a\r\ntiny fraction of Russian materiel is equal to modern Western equipment. Russia\r\nlacks up-to-date communications, computers, and precision munitions. Much\r\nhardware remains from the Soviet buildup, but most of it doesn't work. Soldiers\r\ncannibalize spare parts to keep a few vehicles working. Pilots lack the fuel\r\nand equipment to fly training missions. Russian arms plants still produce\r\nexcellent weapons for export (anti-ship missiles, for example), but the Russian\r\nmilitary can't afford to buy any of them.\r\n\r\n            Russian conventional\r\nforces have grown so flaccid that Russia has altered its nuclear policy. It\r\nused to abjure first-use of nukes. Now first-use is an essential part of\r\nmilitary doctrine, because Russia knows it can't defend itself conventionally.\r\n(The only good news about the military is that it has regained secure control\r\nover its active nuclear weapons--though not over discarded nuclear material.)\r\nEven the Pentagon, which has long featherbedded its budget by inflating the\r\nMoscow threat, has largely stopped pretending that Russia can endanger U.S.\r\nmilitary interests. The Russian army is no longer the great Russian bear but a\r\n\"rather vicious ferret,\" says Mark Galeotti, a Russian military analyst at\r\nBritain's Keele University.\r\n\r\n            This military has decayed immeasurably since the glory days\r\nof the Mighty Red Army. The Russian army broke Napoleon. Soviet troops, in\r\nWinston Churchill's words, \"tore the guts\" out of the Nazis. U.S. officials\r\ncertainly exaggerated the competence of the Soviet military during the Cold\r\nWar, but it was still a great force: 6 million men under arms, a 3-to-1 tank\r\nadvantage, a 2-to-1 aircraft advantage. The Red Army was the only institution\r\nthat matched the Communist Party in prestige. The best and brightest joined the\r\nofficer corps. There were 15 applicants for every slot at some military\r\nschools. The state pampered officers with special stores, chauffeured cars, and\r\ndachas .\r\n\r\n            The Czarist and Soviet\r\narmies were not artful, but they were often effective: weak on offense, strong\r\non defense. They performed poorly in far-flung adventures (the Russo-Japanese\r\nWar, for example) but savaged invaders when the Motherland was under attack.\r\nThey mastered brute-force warfare, throwing huge numbers of troops, tanks, and\r\nshells at the enemy. The U.S.S.R. won World War II by losing 8 million\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n            The Afghanistan invasion vanquished the myth of Soviet\r\nmilitary invincibility and aroused the popular mistrust of the army that\r\npersists today. The breakup of the U.S.S.R. shattered the army into 15 pieces,\r\nas Russia lost nukes, ships, bases, and many of its best officers to newly\r\nindependent republics. In the post-Soviet chaos, youngsters found more ways to\r\nduck conscription, and the quality of the average soldier plummeted. Boris\r\nYeltsin, who didn't trust the army, further damaged it by elevating the\r\ninterior ministry--with its hundreds of thousands of soldiers--as a separate,\r\nindependent foundation of military power. The first Chechen war dealt the final\r\ndisgrace. The hardened rebels slaughtered Russia's ill-prepared men, ambushing\r\nthem by the hundreds in Grozny. Russian mothers traveled to Chechnya, pulled\r\ntheir sons off the front lines, and brought them home.\r\n\r\n            Russia's generals and\r\npoliticians essentially ginned up the new Chechen war as a confidence builder.\r\nRussia has reason to invade Chechnya: The rebellious province has been\r\nagitating to form a separate, antagonistic Muslim state. But Russia was itching\r\nfor an excuse to attack. When Chechens raided the Russian territory of\r\nDagestan, and bombs wrecked Moscow apartment buildings, the army seized the\r\nopportunity. (Many suspect that the bombings were staged to marshal support for\r\nwar.) Because it is a win-at-all-costs war to restore military prestige,\r\nRussian generals have shown utter indifference to civilian casualties and a\r\nwillingness to lie to retain popular support. (Russia, for example,\r\nconsistently undercounts its war dead.) The West tolerates Russia's atrocities\r\nbecause it has no choice and because it is better for Russia to take out its\r\naggression on its own citizens than to go adventuring abroad.\r\n\r\n            The Sherman's march through Chechnya is not just boosting\r\nRussian military pride. It is also increasing the military's political clout.\r\nThe Russian military has long been politically quiescent because a tradition of\r\nprofessionalism pervades the officer corps. But the general staff insisted that\r\nPutin grant them total freedom to prosecute the war. Putin, who wants a victory\r\nto boost his own prospects, granted it, essentially castrating the civilian\r\ndefense ministry and subordinating the interior ministry. Western analysts now\r\nfear that the generals are using Chechnya to reassert control over national\r\nsecurity and foreign policy. Their militarism and nationalism bode ill for\r\nfuture relations between Russia and the West. The general staff, for instance,\r\nhas essentially forbidden Russia from talking to NATO.\r\n\r\n            As for the victory in Chechnya, it's a mirage. For\r\nRussia's generals and politicians, victory simply means flying the Russian flag\r\nin downtown Grozny. But Chechens are fighting a guerrilla war. Russian soldiers\r\nwill shell Grozny to its foundations and fly their flags, but they won't engage\r\nin street-to-street fighting: It's too bloody. So the rebels can melt away and\r\njoin their comrades in Chechnya's southern mountains. Chechnya has been\r\nfighting Moscow for 217 years and hasn't surrendered yet. It won't stop now.\r\nWhen the Russian army continues south, it will find itself in another mountain\r\nwar--a mini-Afghanistan, this time against a tougher and better-organized\r\nenemy. The Chechens will gradually bleed the Russian garrison--one car bomb,\r\none mine, one mortar at a time--until the Russians withdraw in frustration. But\r\nfor now, Putin and his generals will get their victory --a Potemkin triumph for\r\na Potemkin army.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
