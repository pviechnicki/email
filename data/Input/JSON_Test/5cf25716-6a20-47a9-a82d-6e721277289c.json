Each\r\nyear we hear more and more about this holiday. What is it, and where did it\r\ncome from?\r\n\r\n            Kwanzaa is a holiday\r\nhonoring African-American heritage and culture. Celebrated from Dec. 26\r\nthrough Jan. 1, the holiday was created after the 1965 Watts riot by Maulana\r\nRon Karenga , a graduate student and black nationalist, who observed that\r\nblack Americans had no holiday of their own. In the 1960s, Karenga feuded\r\nopenly with other black leaders, and some of his followers were convicted in a\r\nplot to assassinate members of the Black Panthers. In the 1970s, Karenga\r\nhimself was imprisoned for ordering and directing the torture of a young woman.\r\nNow 54 years old, he is chair of Black Studies at California State University\r\nin Long Beach. Last year, apparently rehabilitated in the eyes of many\r\nAfrican-American leaders, Karenga served on the national executive committee\r\nfor the Million Man March.\r\n\r\n            Karenga's\r\nearly attempts to popularize the holiday were directed at a relatively small\r\ngroup of activists. Beginning in the late 1970s, however, Kwanzaa began to\r\nattract coverage in the mainstream press . The attention grew as Karenga\r\nmodified his rhetoric to appeal to a broader audience, and as interest in\r\nmulticulturalism burgeoned in the late 1980s. Kwanzaa was taken up by\r\nmany in the expanding black middle class , whose buying power has\r\nsupported such marketing ventures as the \"Kwanzaa Expos,\" convention-center\r\ngatherings at which Afrocentric goods and art are sold.\r\n\r\n            Karenga took the holiday's name from the Swahili\r\nphrase matunda yakwanza , meaning \"first fruit.\" Swahili words were\r\nchosen because the language, a hybrid of Arabic and Bantu tongues, is tied to\r\nno particular African tribe. Although there are no directly analogous African\r\nholidays, Karenga drew his inspiration from various African harvest festivals.\r\nFrom these he extracted seven principles --unity, self-determination,\r\ncollective work, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. Each of\r\nthe holiday's seven days is meant to symbolize one of these principles.\r\n\r\n            The\r\ncentral Kwanzaa ritual is candle lighting . First, the mkeka\r\n(straw mat) is placed on the table, along with the kinara (candleholder)\r\nand the mishumaa saba (seven candles). The three candles on the right in\r\nthe kinara are red, symbolizing the blood of the African people; the\r\nthree on the left are green, symbolizing the hope of new life; and the black\r\ncandle in the center represents the African people. Around the candles are\r\nplaced the mazeo (fruits), the vibunzi (an ear of corn for each\r\nchild in the family), the zawadi (gifts, preferably handmade), and the\r\nkikombe cha umoja (cup) for shared juice or water.\r\n\r\n            \r\nOn each day of the celebration, a child lights\r\nthe appropriate candle, and the principle for that day is discussed. The\r\nhighlight is the karamu, or feast, on Kuumba , Dec. 31. It\r\ncelebrates creativity, and is \"an opportunity for a confetti storm of cultural\r\nexpression: dance and music, readings, remembrances,\" according to Eric Copage,\r\nauthor of Kwanzaa: An African-American Celebration of Culture and\r\nCooking . The food can be highly symbolic. Angela Shelf Medearis, author of\r\na Kwanzaa cookbook, recommends the following karamu menu: Jambalaya\r\nSalad, Moroccan Honey Chicken, New-Style Collard Greens, and Fruits of Africa\r\nPie.\r\n\r\n            How\r\nwidely celebrated is Kwanzaa? In Karenga's own words, \"It's widespread\r\nbut not mainstream.\" Some enthusiasts, such as writer Linn Washington Jr., claim that Kwanzaa has as many as 13 million\r\ncelebrants, and the Detroit News reports that researchers estimate the\r\nKwanzaa-related market at $500 million annually. Despite Karenga's original\r\nintention, Kwanzaa takes on a more commercial flavor every year. Hallmark makes\r\nKwanzaa cards, and there are Kwanzaa posters, books, CDs, and mass-produced\r\nkinaras . But Kwanzaa was not intended to replace Christmas, and many\r\nAfrican-American families celebrate both holidays.\r\n\r\n            And Hanukkah ? It too, if not invented in the United\r\nStates, has taken on a different shape and gained importance here. Although\r\nHanukkah has been on the Jewish calendar for more than two millennia, it was,\r\nuntil recently, a relatively minor holiday. The pressures of Christmas,\r\nhowever, have elevated Hanukkah for many Jewish families to eight days of\r\ncelebration and gift-giving. (A new book maintains that even Christmas is a\r\ntrumped-up holiday. See \"Summary Judgment.\")\r\n\r\n            Hanukkah\r\ncommemorates the victory in 165 B.C. of a small band of Jews, led by Judas\r\nMaccabaeus, over the Greeks who ruled Palestine at the time. The Jews reclaimed\r\nthe Temple from the Greeks, and rededicated it as their place of worship. But\r\nthey had only one day's supply of oil to light the flame, which was supposed to\r\nburn constantly. Miraculously, the flame burned for eight days and nights,\r\nuntil the oil supply was replenished. Following the rebellion, the kingdom of\r\nIsrael was restored for 200 years.\r\n\r\n            \r\nSome Kwanzaa rituals, most notably the focus on\r\ncandles, seem to have been borrowed from Hanukkah. The center of the eight-day\r\nHanukkah celebration is the nightly family gathering to light candles in a\r\ncandelabra known as the \"menorah.\" Oily foods, particularly latkes (potato\r\npancakes), are served during dinner to symbolize the Temple miracle. By\r\ntradition, family members play with the dreidel , a four-sided spinning\r\ntop, and children receive Hanukkah gelt (chocolate coins covered with gold\r\nfoil) and other presents.\r\n\r\n            Unlike\r\nKwanzaa, Hanukkah enjoys no agreed-upon spelling in English. The most\r\ncommon variant is \"Chanukah,\" reflecting the proper pronunciation of the\r\nopening consonant, which is like the \"ch\" in \"Bach.\" The spelling employed in\r\nthis article is from The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual ,\r\nSlate's guide in such matters.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               References:\r\n            \r\n\r\n            If you'd\r\nlike to know more about Kwanzaa, you can read The Complete Kwanzaa:\r\nCelebrating our Cultural Harvest , by Dorothy Winbush Riley; A Kwanzaa\r\nKeepsake: Celebrating the Holiday With New Traditions and Feasts , by\r\nJessica B.
