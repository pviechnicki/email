Before filming began, Quintanilla\r\nsaid: \"Nobody knows more about my daughter and our life than I do. ... If they\r\nget out of line as far as the story goes, I'll put them back on course.\" Either\r\nthey never got out of line or Quintanilla put them back on course, because\r\nSelena does not stray far from the facts, at least as they are recounted\r\nin the secondary sources.\r\n\r\n            When\r\nAbraham discovered that his daughter could sing, he turned his children into a\r\nband called Selena y Los Dinos. They debuted in 1979, when Selena was 8, and\r\nstarting in 1980, performed frequently at the family restaurant in Lake\r\nJackson, Texas. Selena's father pushed her to sing in Spanish, which she didn't\r\nknow how to speak. The group did gigs across South Texas, performing mostly\r\nTejano music (described by Billboard as \"Mexican polkas and cumbias,\r\nmixed with elements of rock, pop, country, and even rap\"). Selena eventually\r\nbroke into the Mexican market on an unprecedented scale for a Tejano artist\r\nwith spotty Spanish, giving concerts before crowds of 120,000 people.\r\nInterested in fashion since childhood, she opened a boutique called Selena Etc.\r\nin January 1994. The actual designer of the Selena line, Martin G?mez, gets a\r\nbrief mention in the film. In March 1994, she won a Grammy for best\r\nMexican-American album. In July 1994, the biggest hit of her career, \"Amor\r\nProhibido,\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Latin chart. Though the film\r\ndoesn't go into all the details, it is correct in indicating that Selena was\r\npoised for mainstream success when she was killed.\r\n\r\n            The film also reflects Selena's down-to-earth style, at\r\nleast as described in media accounts and in such books as the unauthorized\r\nbiography Selena: Como la Flor (1996), by Joe Nick Patoski, a senior\r\neditor at Texas Monthly . Selena the movie ticks off the points\r\nmade in numerous profiles. Though the singer drove a red Porsche convertible,\r\nshe dined at Pizza Hut, shopped in malls, mowed her own lawn, and lived in a\r\nmiddle-class neighborhood in Corpus Christi at the time of her death (next door\r\nto her parents and brother, a detail left out of Selena ). The film\r\nfaithfully records her status as a role model. On-screen, Selena studies on the\r\ntour bus and asks children seeking autographs how they're doing in school. In\r\nlife, she got her high-school degree via correspondence from Chicago's American\r\nSchool (the Osmonds' alma mater), and was one of the only Tejano stars not to\r\nendorse a beer brand.\r\n\r\n            One fact\r\nmissing from the film is that both she and her family were Jehovah's Witnesses.\r\nThough Selena was not an official member of the sect, she was a believer and\r\nwent to Bible study with other believers. The Houston Chronicle reported\r\nthat when Abraham showed up at the hospital after Selena's shooting, he said\r\nshe wouldn't want a blood transfusion because of her faith (by that point,\r\nthough, she'd already been given blood, to no avail).\r\n\r\n            \r\nOn-screen, Abraham comes across as a demanding\r\nbut good-hearted stage father. He forces his children to form a band and yells\r\nat Selena for wearing a bustier during a performance. He angrily forbids his\r\ndaughter to marry Chris Perez, a guitarist in the band. (In both film and life,\r\nthe couple elope and the Quintanilla family eventually accepts the union.) In\r\nreal life, Quintanilla's stage-father parenting did occasion some criticism:\r\nSelena : Como la Flor recalls battles between Abraham and Selena's\r\njunior-high teachers over the girl's increasing absences.\r\n\r\n            As for\r\nYolanda Saldivar--the founder of Selena's fan club, an employee at her\r\nboutique, and her killer--Quintanilla wanted to leave her out of the movie\r\nentirely, until the producers convinced him not to. The film implies that\r\nSelena and Yolanda were friendly but not actually friends. In truth, they were\r\nquite close, and Yolanda often traveled with Selena. Currently serving a life\r\nsentence for the crime, Yolanda told 20/20 that Selena called her \"Mom.\"\r\nSelena addresses neither Yolanda's obsession with Selena (her apartment\r\nwas a shrine to the singer) nor the tabloid rumor, denied by all and not backed\r\nby any evidence, that they were lovers.\r\n\r\n            As the script indicates, the family thought that Yolanda\r\nwas embezzling money, and confronted her. The film does not re-enact the\r\nmurder, choosing instead to \"cover\" the crime in an 11 o'clock news style, but\r\nthe details are accurate. An announcer states that Selena had gone to the motel\r\nto pick up papers from Yolanda when she was shot, as family members later\r\ntestified. Next we see Yolanda holed up in her truck with a gun to her head,\r\nsaying, \"I'm so ashamed,\" and, \"Look what I've done to my best friend.\" She did\r\nsay those things during a 9-? hour standoff with police, though she also\r\naccused Abraham of having raped her--a charge never substantiated.\r\n\r\n            The final\r\nmoments of the film resemble a music-video tribute--we see an empty stadium and\r\na candlelight vigil. Selena's death did inspire an outpouring of grief and\r\nattract the attention of the mainstream media (inspired by the success of their\r\nSelena-memorial issue, People launched a Spanish version of the\r\nmagazine). As the movie implies with a scene in which a crowd forms around\r\nSelena in a Los Angeles store and a white employee asks, \"Who's Selena?\" many\r\nwhites learned about the singer only because of the way she died. Madonna was\r\nreportedly the sole Anglo star to send her condolences.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
