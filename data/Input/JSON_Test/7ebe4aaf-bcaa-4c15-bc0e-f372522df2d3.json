The treaty,\r\nwhich needed 67 votes for ratification, was defeated 51-48. Only four\r\nRepublicans sided with Democrats in favor of it. Although President Clinton\r\nvowed to continue to fight for its ratification, Majority Leader Trent Lott\r\nsaid it would not be reconsidered during his term. Other nations had promised\r\nto follow the U.S. lead. The Democratic spin: Republicans let politics trump\r\ninternational security. The Republican spin: A treaty that flawed would never\r\nhave worked. The Democratic reply: It certainly won't work now. Newspapers\r\nvariously said the vote hurt 1) Clinton's ability to set foreign policy\r\n( Los Angeles Times ); 2) America's global leadership\r\n( New York Times ); and 3) centrist, bipartisan politics (\r\n                  Washington Post\r\n               ).\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Pakistan's military ousted its elected government. Coup leader\r\nGen. Pervaiz Musharraf suspended the constitution and declared the country to\r\nbe under military rule, but did not announce plans to install a new government.\r\nMusharraf accused former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of weakening the military,\r\ncrippling the economy, and tolerating corruption. Western analysts worried that\r\nmilitary rule would exacerbate: 1) the region's instability ( Los Angeles\r\nTimes ); 2) the fragility of Pakistan's democracy; and 3) the ascendancy\r\nof Islamic militants ( USA\r\nToday ). Pakistanis' reaction: After Sharif's regime, anything will be\r\nan improvement ( Washington Post ).\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Basketball great Wilt Chamberlain died. \"Wilt the Stilt,\"\r\nwidely considered the best player of all time, is the only one ever to score\r\n100 points in a game. He captured national attention in the 1960s through an\r\nintense rivalry with Bill Russell and again in the 1990s with his claim to have\r\nbedded 20,000 women. The Los Angeles Times said\r\nChamberlain's dominance as a center forever \"changed the way basketball is\r\nplayed.\" The \r\n                  Chicago Tribune\r\n                declared that Chamberlain's skill\r\nand popularity \"saved the NBA. ... Had there been no Wilt, there would have\r\nbeen no Dr. J or Bird or Magic or--perish the thought!--Michael.\"\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               The world's population reached 6 billion. It has doubled since\r\n1960, but growth is slowing as urbanization, education, and family planning\r\nincrease worldwide. Most of the continued growth will occur in the developing\r\nworld. The United Nations predicts that population will level off near 10\r\nbillion late in the next century. The rosy spin: Despite what doomsayers\r\npredicted, overpopulation hasn't caused global catastrophe. The gloomy spin:\r\nWell, not yet.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               The AFL-CIO endorsed \r\n               Al Gore's presidential\r\nbid. The endorsement lets Gore use the union's resources and 13\r\nmillion members for political organizing. The optimistic spin: Labor's support\r\ngives Gore a great boost . The jaded spin: Labor's support for the\r\nDemocratic front-runner is a non-story. The AFL-CIO spin: Either way, the\r\nattention shows we're a force to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Four teams remain in baseball's playoffs. The Red Sox and\r\nYankees are vying for the American League title. The Braves and Mets are\r\ncompeting in the National League championship. Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez\r\nthrew six no-hit innings in the final game against Cleveland to make the Red\r\nSox only the fourth\r\nteam ever to overcome a two-game deficit in the playoffs' first round. The\r\nMets, who barely made the playoffs after a dismal mid-season performance, are\r\ncompeting with Boston for recognition as the \"Cinderella team.\" The Yankees and\r\nBraves are fighting for recognition as the decade's best team.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               A Colorado grand jury issued no charges in the JonBenet Ramsey\r\ncase. After 13 months of investigating, the jury deemed the evidence\r\ninsufficient. Colorado Gov. Bill Owens said he would assemble a new team of\r\nprosecutors to continue the investigation. Some critics charged that the lack\r\nof an indictment revealed that the police work was botched. Others said that\r\nthe continued investigation of a rich, white victim's death showed that race\r\nand class influence the justice system.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               A British court ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet could be\r\nextradited. If his appeals fail, the former Chilean dictator could\r\nstand trial in Spain on 35 charges of torture and conspiracy. Pinochet's spin:\r\nThe court is violating the rights of Chileans by imposing foreign laws.\r\nProsecutors' spin: Look who's\r\ntalking about violating the rights of Chileans.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Margaret \r\n               MacGregor won the first man-vs.-woman boxing\r\nmatch. The undefeated, 5-foot-4-inch 36-year-old unanimously won all\r\nfour rounds against male boxer Loi Chow, who is 5 foot 2 and has a record of\r\n0-3. Some observers objected to a man hitting a woman. MacGregor's supporters\r\nsaid she had landed a blow for \r\ngender equality. Detractors complained that she should have picked on\r\nsomeone her own\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Texas Gov. George W. Bush criticized congressional\r\nRepublicans. First he said House Republicans shouldn't \"balance their\r\nbudget on the backs of the poor.\" Then he said his party often neglects the\r\ndisadvantaged by focusing on economic wealth. Democrats called Bush a \r\nwolf in sheep's clothing. Republican opponents accused Bush of running for\r\npresident on the backs of\r\ncongressmen. But Bush said his comments made a \"positive case\" for\r\nRepublican compassion, and some pundits said he was astute to recognize that\r\nthe Republican \"revolution is dead\" (Al\r\nHunt, Capital Gang ).
