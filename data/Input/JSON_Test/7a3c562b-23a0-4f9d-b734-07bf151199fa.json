(You?ll have to go farther\r\n        north to reach the rugged fell landscapes. ) The reputation of this\r\n        area was guaranteed when the Victorian railway was built. Workers from\r\n        the cities in northern England came to enjoy the fresh air, and rich\r\n        industrialists built large lakeside houses surrounded by pleasant\r\n        landscaped gardens. Many of these manors have now been converted into\r\n        hotels known for comfortable accommodations and stunning views.\r\n        Lake Windermere\r\n        The largest of the lakes at 17 km (10 miles) north to south,\r\n        Lake Windermere has always been the most accessible, and therefore, not\r\n        surprisingly, it is now the most developed. During the summer you will\r\n        have to share the shoreline with many thousands of other visitors.\r\n        Ferry services plying the lake provide one of the best ways to view\r\n        coastline and the thickly wooded hills above. Boats are available for\r\n        rent, and water-skiing and powerboat racing are very popular\r\n        pastimes.\r\n        Among the several islands of interest on the lake is Belle\r\n        Isle, still privately owned by the Curwen family, descendants of\r\n        Fletcher Christian, of Mutiny on the Bounty fame, who was born near\r\n        Cockermouth. It is said that after the crew of the Bounty settled on\r\n        Pitcairn Island, Fletcher somehow found his way back to England, living\r\n        out his life on Belle Isle, protected by his family. Several local\r\n        residents are said to have caught a glimpse of him but there is no firm\r\n        evidence to support this claim.\r\n        Bowness and Windermere\r\n        Originally separate settlements, these two towns have now\r\n        merged to the point that visitors can?t tell where one starts and the\r\n        other finishes. Genteel Windermere is more modern, having grown up\r\n        around the railway station after the line was opened in 1847. If you\r\n        travel by train to the Lakes, this is where you will arrive. Just\r\n        around the corner from the station is the Tourist Information Centre,\r\n        which will supply all the information you need about touring,\r\n        accommodations, and restaurants. The town has a number of art galleries\r\n        and many fine period hotels, and although it has few attractions it is\r\n        a good base for trips farther afield in the Lakes.\r\n        Bowness began as small fishing village on the lakeside, but\r\n        today it is a resort. It?s still modest in size, but it becomes full to\r\n        the brim on summer weekends, when families head here for fresh air. The\r\n        town has many hotels and a number of shops where you can buy souvenirs\r\n        or outdoor clothing.\r\n        Everyone seems to congregate around the lake?s edge, where\r\n        feeding the ducks and swans is a popular pastime. This is where the\r\n        cruise boats dock. The ticket kiosks are right next to the wooden\r\n        berths. You can take a lake tour or a ferry trip to Ambleside in the\r\n        north or Lakeside in the south.\r\n        In the center of Bowness is the Old Laundry Visitor Centre;\r\n        the theater housed here offers a program of performances throughout the\r\n        year. Next door to the theater is The World of Beatrix Potter, an\r\n        exhibition that provides a comprehensive introduction to the woman and\r\n        her work. The presentation begins with a short video about the Potter\r\n        stories and how they relate to the Lake District landscape. A\r\n        delightful series of dioramas then introduce Peter Rabbit, Mrs.\r\n        Tiggi-Winkle, and Squirrel Nutkin, among others, set in scenes taken\r\n        from Potter?s books. Another longer video relates to the life of Potter\r\n        and her transformation from writer and illustrator (she did the\r\n        original drawings for the books) to farmer, solicitor?s wife, and early\r\n        eco-warrior.\r\n        North of the town, Windermere Steamboat Museum looks back\r\n        to the golden age of lake transport. A number of steamboats dating from\r\n        the Victorian age until the 1920?s are on display, all lovingly\r\n        restored. Pride of place goes to SL Dolly, the oldest mechanically\r\n        powered boat in the world (c. ? 1850), which was restored after\r\n        spending over 60 years at the bottom of Lake Windermere. Weather\r\n        permitting, you can take a ride on one of the steamers.\r\n        At Brockhole, about 2 km (3 miles) northwest of Windermere\r\n        along the lake shore, is the Lake District National Park Visitor\r\n        Centre, a very good place to gather information and plan your strategy\r\n        for exploring. An audio-visual show gives information not only about\r\n        the National Park but also about the work the staff does to protect the\r\n        landscape. The mansion that now houses the Visitor Centre was once a\r\n        private residence. Built in 1900, it reflects the Arts and Crafts style\r\n        that was fashionable at the time. Surrounding the Centre are beautiful\r\n        gardens with trails that lead through woodland and along the lake\r\n        shore. There are places to relax or enjoy a picnic, and adventure\r\n        playgrounds for the children. Special events such as pet shows, dog\r\n        trials, and historical theme days are held throughout the summer.\r\n        Ambleside\r\n        Just a few kilometers north of Brockhole, at the northern\r\n        tip of Lake Windermere, Ambleside is one of the major towns of the\r\n        region. At the height of the summer season you?ll share the town with\r\n        many thousands of people, all jostling to stay on the narrow sidewalks.\r\n        In the Victorian era, the town expanded northward from its original\r\n        site (a Roman settlement at Waterhead); the commercial center now lies\r\n        approximately 1 km (1?2 mile) from the lake.\r\n        Waterhead, Ambleside?s harbor, has a few shops that cater\r\n        to the ferries, cruise boats, and other vessels that dock here. There?s\r\n        a Tourist Information Centre in the main car park (open summer only).\r\n        You?ll find the remains of the Roman fort Galava a little way to the\r\n        north, at the confluence ofthe Brathay and Rothay, two of the rivers\r\n        that feed Lake Windermere. Loughrigg, a low fell that gives spectacular\r\n        views of both Windermere and Grasmere, is a short climb to the\r\n        northwest.\r\n        Bridge House in Ambleside is one of the most popular sites\r\n        and perhaps one of the most photographed buildings in the Lake\r\n        District. Dating from the 17th century, it was a summerhouse for\r\n        Ambleside Hall, a large mansion built a century earlier, which, sadly,\r\n        no longer exists. The tiny two-story slate house, which spans the\r\n        bubbling waters of Stock Ghyll, now serves as a National Trust\r\n        Information Centre and pick-up point for the National Trust tour bus.\r\n        Across the main road from the house are several small streets that\r\n        illustrate how the old town must have looked in the 17th century. Soak\r\n        in the atmosphere as you wander down narrow alleys and cobbled lanes\r\n        among white-washed cottages.\r\n        Stock Ghyll Force was one of the most popular visitor\r\n        attractions during Victorian times. The 21-m (70-ft) waterfall was\r\n        easily accessible from the town, even by ladies wearing the large heavy\r\n        skirts of the time. Today people still take the same route to the force\r\n        (sign-posted behind Barclays Bank in the town center) and to Stock\r\n        Ghyll Water Mill. The Armitt Library and Museum Centre, just a little\r\n        way beyond Bridge House, offers an interesting view on the life of the\r\n        Lakes through the letters and books of local people. Founded by Mary\r\n        Louisa Armitt in 1909, it provided a resource for scholars in the area;\r\n        she donated her own collection of books, which encouraged others to\r\n        follow suit. The library absorbed the Ambleside Book Club (Wordsworth\r\n        had been its most famous member) and the Ruskin Library, which included\r\n        many of Ruskin?s private letters. Over the years the collection has\r\n        grown to incorporate many objects and works of art, including a number\r\n        of original scientific watercolors by Beatrix Potter, which show yet\r\n        another facet of her talent. The collection is accessible via a hi-tech\r\n        touch-screen directory.\r\n        Troutbeck\r\n        Sitting on the slopes of the Troutbeck Valley high above\r\n        Bowness and Ambleside, Troutbeck is a tiny village of traditional farms\r\n        and barns. The village is historically significant, and there are many\r\n        fascinating architectural details to be found here. The most famous\r\n        building in the village is the 17th-century Town End Yeoman?s\r\n        Farmhouse. A perfect example of a statesman farmer?s house, this\r\n        structure had been in the hands of the same family from the time it was\r\n        built until it was taken over by the National Trust in 1947. There are\r\n        two main rooms downstairs???the ?firehouse,? a utility area for washing\r\n        and brewing, and the ?downhouse,? a living area with fireplace. The\r\n        master bedroom is just off the downhouse; other members of the\r\n        household slept in the loft. Town End is full of wonderful artifacts\r\n        from 17th-century daily life, such as cooking utensils???bowls, pans,\r\n        crockery, and hooks to hang hare and pheasants???rag rugs made by the\r\n        women of the household, and laundry implements such as a ?dolly? used\r\n        for stirring the clothes in the washing tub.\r\n        Grasmere\r\n        Lake Grasmere (11?2 km/1 mile long) and Grasmere village\r\n        lie below a circle of rounded hills. Access to the lakeside is\r\n        restricted, but the view from Loughrigg Terrace is one of the best in\r\n        the Lake District and an easy walk from the village. Rydal Water, the\r\n        smallest of the lakes in the entire Lake District, sits beside it;\r\n        thousands of rushes line its banks. Grasmere village is one of the\r\n        prettiest communities in the Lakes, but also one of the busiest. A\r\n        settlement of stone cottages founded by Norse settlers, it became home\r\n        to William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy in 1799. The surrounding\r\n        landscape, with dry?stone walls, farmhouses, and the Rothay river\r\n        valley, became a source of inspiration for their artistic endeavors.\r\n        Dove Cottage was their first home. Wordsworth loved the place and wrote\r\n        some of his most memorable poetry while living here. The house has\r\n        changed little since then; it has been faithfully preserved along with\r\n        the garden the siblings faithfully tended. Much of the furniture inside\r\n        belonged to the family.\r\n        In 1802 William married Mary Hutchinson; the cottage became\r\n        their family home. Eventually there wasn?t enough space to house their\r\n        children and their many visitors, so in 1808 the family moved to a\r\n        larger home on the other side of the village. The Wordsworth Trust now\r\n        manages the property and offers a guided tour of the cottage that\r\n        provides insights into the life of the writer, his family, and his\r\n        friends. Behind the cottage, the Wordsworth Museum displays many of\r\n        Wordsworth?s original manuscripts and other personal objects.\r\n        Headphones allow you to listen to some of William?s works while you\r\n        view images of the landscapes that inspired him. The poet and many\r\n        members of his family are buried in the graveyard of the Parish Church\r\n        of St. Oswald, in the heart of Grasmere. The church itself is worthy of\r\n        investigation. The structure dates from the 13th century, but a rather\r\n        dull stucco finish was added in the 19th century. A rush-bearing\r\n        ceremony (see page 93) is held here each August. At the corner of the\r\n        churchyard is Sara Nelson?s Gingerbread Shop, which is still making\r\n        gingerbread and other goodies just as Sara herself once did for\r\n        Victorian visitors who came to find Wordsworth?s house. The tiny shop\r\n        was once the village schoolroom, where children would sit with chalk\r\n        and slate board.\r\n        The Wordsworth family made one more move, to Rydal Mount at\r\n        the eastern tip of Rydal Water, and it was here that William lived for\r\n        the last 37 years of his life. It is a much grander residence than Dove\r\n        Cottage, yet it remains true to the poet?s philosophy and world\r\n        view???it?s neither too imposing nor too lavish. Still owned by\r\n        descendants of the poet, it is a family home rather than a museum,\r\n        though it has been open to the public since 1970. There are many\r\n        personal pieces and family portraits in the house, along with original\r\n        Wordsworth manuscripts. The grounds are also very much as Wordsworth\r\n        and Dorothy landscaped them, with four acres of sculptured lawn and a\r\n        natural environment in which animals and birds thrive. The house has\r\n        beautiful views of Lake Windermere, which must have brought the poet\r\n        great pleasure in his later years.\r\n        The whole area around Grasmere and Rydal Water is full of\r\n        gentle walks in beautiful deciduous woodland. For a wonderful walk that\r\n        fills a whole day, try linking Grasmere village, Dove Cottage, and\r\n        Rydal Mount. The route is 8 km (5 miles) long and includes some\r\n        beautiful scenery. You could finish the trip with afternoon tea at Dove\r\n        Cottage Teashop.\r\n        Hawkshead\r\n        A village in miniature that is a delight to the eye,\r\n        Hawkshead is comprised of whitewashed buildings huddled together around\r\n        a tiny central square. The maze of narrow alleys that link the houses\r\n        can be confusing, as there are few street signs to guide you, but the\r\n        Tourist Information Centre provides an invaluable guide. Park in the\r\n        main car park and walk the few meters into the village. There are many\r\n        gems to be discovered: tiny leaded windows, gargoyles in the eaves, and\r\n        flower-filled boxes on every window ledge.\r\n        The area was part of a huge tract of land owned by Furness\r\n        Abbey, and the village produced cloth from their flocks, which went to\r\n        market at Kendal. One of the oldest buildings, the Courthouse, was\r\n        built in the 15th century. Just outside of Hawkshead, it is all that\r\n        remains of the old manor house built by the monks of Furness, most of\r\n        which was destroyed during the Reformation. The Courthouse now houses\r\n        the Museum of Rural Life. From 1778 to 1787 Wordsworth was a pupil at\r\n        the Hawkshead Grammar School, situated across from the Tourist\r\n        Information Centre. The fledgling poet carved his name in one of the\r\n        plain wooden desks, which proves that even a literary giant can once\r\n        have been a naughty schoolboy. During this time he and his brothers\r\n        lodged with Anne Tyson in a little house in the village.\r\n        The Beatrix Potter Gallery is housed in a tiny building on\r\n        Main Street that was once the office of William Heelis, Potter?s\r\n        solicitor husband. Exhibiting a range of art works by the author, the\r\n        gallery manages to convey a sense of the day-to-day life of Beatrix the\r\n        author and illustrator and of her other life as Mrs. Heelis, wife and\r\n        sheep farmer.\r\n        Two other notable buildings in Hawkshead are the Quaker\r\n        Meeting House, dating from 1688, and the Minstrel?s Gallery Caf? on\r\n        Flag Street, a 15th-century building that now provides refreshment for\r\n        today?s visitors.\r\n        In the hills northeast of Hawkshead is Tarn Hows. Created\r\n        by the Marshall family (the original owners of the land) as a garden\r\n        attraction, it has become one of the most popular sites in the Lake\r\n        District. The family dammed the narrow valley and planted many of the\r\n        lakeside trees. Beatrix Potter bought the tarn in 1929 and bequeathed\r\n        it to the National Trust. Not just beautiful, it is a good place for\r\n        those who enjoy a gentle stroll, popular with families and visitors\r\n        with disabilities. The car park is barely 500 m (1?2 mile) from the\r\n        tarn, and the footpaths around the water are wide, with gentle\r\n        slopes.\r\n        Hill Top\r\n        Beatrix Potter?s farm house and retreat is on the western\r\n        shore of Lake Windermere at the village of Near Sawrey. The house was\r\n        bought with the royalties she earned from her first book, The Tales of\r\n        Peter Rabbit. Potter received inspiration for many more characters from\r\n        the animals in the village and surrounding farmland. The 17th-century\r\n        cottage was her home from 1905; this was the place where she enjoyed\r\n        the life of a lady farmer, tending her crops and breeding Herdwick\r\n        sheep, a breed which was at that time waning in popularity but of which\r\n        she was very fond. It is said that one of the conditions of her bequest\r\n        to the National Trust was that Herdwick sheep must always be bred on\r\n        her farms. The Tower Bank Arms, a pub that was featured in The Tale of\r\n        Gemima Puddleduck, is very close to the cottage and a good place to\r\n        stop for refreshment. Nearby is Esthwaite Water, a quiet lake that has\r\n        a reputation for go od trout fishing.\r\n        Grizedale\r\n        Grizedale is a forested area of nearly 121?2 sq km (8 sq\r\n        miles) between Lakes Windermere and Coniston. This ancient woodland of\r\n        mixed deciduous and coniferous trees provided a source of fuel for the\r\n        furnaces of the charcoal industry and the bobbin mills. Now under the\r\n        control of the Forestry Commission, the forest has many kilometers of\r\n        footpaths and cycle-ways to enjoy. Grizedale Visitor and Wildlife\r\n        Centre has maps and information, particularly about the 75 sculptures\r\n        visitors can find out in the woodland. These were all fashioned out of\r\n        natural materials by local and international sculptors. The Gallery in\r\n        the Forest, once the old sawmill, houses many other exhibits, and the\r\n        Theatre in the Forest holds concerts and performances on weekends in\r\n        the summer.\r\n        South of Grizedale are a number of interesting attractions\r\n        that you can reach by car or by lake ferry. Once at Lakeside on the\r\n        southern shore of Lake Windermere, trains belonging to the Lakeside and\r\n        Haverthwaite Railway can take you on a pleasant 5-km (31?2-mile) trip\r\n        between Lakeside and the village of Haverthwaite. The thundering engine\r\n        will transport you back to the age of steam. At the Aquarium of the\r\n        Lakes, which is just beside the Lakeside Railway Station, you can\r\n        familiarize yourself with the varieties of aquatic life that can be\r\n        found around the National Park and beyond. Freshwater fish species swim\r\n        in the tanks; there?s also a seashore exhibit with a wave machine. More\r\n        exotic exhibits include playful otters and a large sea-water tank\r\n        housing sharks and sting rays. It?s an exciting and well-planned\r\n        aquarium, interesting whatever the weather but certainly a good place\r\n        to spend a rainy afternoon. (You can buy a combination ticket for the\r\n        railway and the aquarium. )\r\n        Over 60 bobbin mills once dotted the Windermere area. At\r\n        Newby Mill near Lakeside Stott Park, Bobbin Mill was still operating\r\n        commercially as recently as 1974. Twenty men once worked to produce\r\n        turned goods for the wool mills, a market that eventually dried up when\r\n        the wool industry went into decline. The steam engine that\r\n        traditionally powered the plant was recommissioned in 1992 and is\r\n        running three days a week. Guided tours through the mill, passing the\r\n        leather belts that turn the shafts and over the wood shavings that\r\n        scatter the floor, give an account of life at the mill during Victorian\r\n        times.\r\n        Cartmel\r\n        Situated in the middle of the Cartmel peninsula south of\r\n        Lake Windermere, the village of Cartmel has been at the heart of some\r\n        important events in English history. In 1188 William Marshall gave land\r\n        to build a priory at Cartmel, and during the Middle Ages it was a large\r\n        and very wealthy concern. In his original covenant, Marshall stipulated\r\n        that money would be available for the priory only if a part of the\r\n        church were opened to the people of the surrounding countryside for\r\n        worship. Thus, in effect, the priory?s church became a parish church\r\n        even though it was tended by a closed religious order. This clause\r\n        became important at the time of the ?dissolution,? when Henry VIII\r\n        destroyed other monasteries and priories. Cartmel church was saved only\r\n        because it also served as a parish church for the community. Wander\r\n        around the church (13th?15th century) to find some interesting\r\n        artifacts of local history. Look for the plaque dedicated to William\r\n        Myers, who, it says, died on 30 February 1762. There?s also the\r\n        so-called Vinegar Bible, dating from 1716. This volume shows a rare\r\n        printer?s error: in the story in the Gospel of John about Jesus\r\n        changing water into wine, the word ?vineyard? was misprinted as\r\n        ?vinegar. ? There is very little left of the actual priory???after it\r\n        had been destroyed the stone was used to build the village houses???but\r\n        the Gate House remains intact. It has been used over the centuries as a\r\n        courthouse, a school, and a village shop, and now houses a small\r\n        museum.\r\n        Cartmel is a picturesque village, with winding streets and\r\n        fine houses. As you wander you may be surprised to find a horse-racing\r\n        track, and you may be even more surprised to find no one is here: the\r\n        track stays silent except for two race meetings a year (late May and\r\n        late August, on the long Bank Holiday weekends). On these days the\r\n        whole neighborhood turns out and the tiny grandstand is full of people\r\n        cheering.\r\n        A few kilometers to the southwest you?ll find Holker Hall,\r\n        a historic house owned by Lord and Lady Cavendish. It has beautiful\r\n        landscaped gardens???it?s said that the warm air of the Gulf Stream\r\n        aids in the production of the many exotic blooms. The family offered\r\n        their home as a refuge to Queen Mary in the days after the abdication\r\n        of her son Edward VIII in 1936. She came here to escape the public eye.\r\n        (All this was in the days before the paparazzi, of course. ) The\r\n        Lakeland Motor Museum on the grounds has around 100 exhibits of various\r\n        forms of vintage transport. One wing of the house is open to the\r\n        public, and the estate also supports a 50-hectare (125-acre) deer\r\n        park.\r\n        Kendal\r\n        The gateway to the Lakes for those traveling from the\r\n        south, this small sturdy town grew rich from trade in wool and cloth\r\n        that came from the central lakes. Kendal Green cloth was famed\r\n        throughout the land from the Middle Ages onward???it was said to have\r\n        been worn by Robin Hood. Kendal was the first town in the area to\r\n        receive a Market Charter in 1189, which ensured its commercial\r\n        prosperity. The town is still bustling today. The oldest sections are\r\n        constrained within a one-way traffic system that gets clogged in summer\r\n        but there are many surprises to be found if you take the time to wander\r\n        the narrow streets. Look out for the Chocolate Shop, which first opened\r\n        for business in 1657; the shop sells sumptuous and brightly wrapped\r\n        treats, and the caf? on the upper floor serves unusual chocolate dishes\r\n        and drinks.\r\n        The remains of historic Kendal Castle overlook the town.\r\n        The Norman castle was the home of the Parr family, famous for having\r\n        provided Henry VIII with his sixth and last wife, Catherine. She\r\n        outlived him and returned to the castle after his death. The Parish\r\n        Church of Kendal, built on land bequeathed to the church in Norman\r\n        times, has the second widest nave in England. Next to it is Abbot Hall,\r\n        a handsome Georgian Mansion that now houses the Abbott Hall Art Gallery\r\n        and Museum of Lakeland Life complex. The main house, built in 1759,\r\n        holds the largest collection of George Romney paintings in the country.\r\n        Romney (1734?1802) was considered to be the third master of portraiture\r\n        in the 18th century, alongside Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds.\r\n        Because of the gallery?s high profile it attracts many important\r\n        traveling exhibitions; check with the Tourist Information Centre about\r\n        the current program. The Museum, situated in the renovated stable block\r\n        of the house, has many dioramas of Lakeland life and industry from the\r\n        last 200 years. It highlights the local craftsmen who helped Kendal and\r\n        the other Lakes towns to thrive, and provides a comprehensive overview\r\n        of how the economy of the Lakes has evolved and how the landscape has\r\n        been changed by man.\r\n        The Kendal Museum of Archaeology and Natural History, near\r\n        the Railway Station, displays Neolithic and Roman finds from sites\r\n        throughout the Lakes area, geological specimens, and a curious\r\n        collection of stuffed animals from the region and throughout the world.\r\n        Alfred Wainwright, prominent fell walker and writer, was curator here\r\n        for many years. His guides with their maps and plans provide the\r\n        classic companion to the high ground of the Lakes and his larger books\r\n        make beautiful souvenirs. He died in 1990; his old office has been\r\n        recreated in his memory.\r\n        Brewery Arts Centre, the home of community art in Kendal,\r\n        offers classes, exhibitions, and performances, along with restaurants\r\n        and coffee shops. The continually changing program provides something\r\n        for everyone, whether you want to join in or simply watch a master\r\n        craftsman at work. The Centre sits just back from Highgate, on the same\r\n        street with the Tourist Information Centre.\r\n        The Southwest\r\n        The southwestern corner of the Lake District has some of\r\n        the moodiest landscapes in all of the UK. Home to thousands of sheep\r\n        and a few scattered farming families, the area is characterized by the\r\n        stark beauty of bare peaks, rugged fells, and the most remote lakes,\r\n        combined with challenging, narrow roads. You?re sure to find a little\r\n        remote spot all to yourself.\r\n        Coniston\r\n        Historically a center of copper mining and smelting,\r\n        Coniston was a true working town and this heritage sets it apart from\r\n        the other major towns in the Lakes. Less sophisticated than Ambleside\r\n        and less commercial than Bowness, it has a simple charm that many\r\n        visitors find more appealing. The remains of mining and quarrying sites\r\n        on the face of The Old Man of Coniston, the mountain above the town,\r\n        are a reminder of its history. John Ruskin, whose house sits on the\r\n        eastern shore of Coniston Water, chose to be buried here, in the\r\n        graveyard of the parish church, rather than in Westminster Abbey in\r\n        London. The town in turn has honored him with a small museum.\r\n        Coniston Water\r\n        Coniston Water is long and narrow, the straightest of the\r\n        Lake District lakes. It was this feature that attracted speedboat racer\r\n        Donald Campbell. He?d had a series of victories in various types of\r\n        powered vehicles, including a victory on land at Daytona Beach in\r\n        Florida, before coming to Coniston in 1967 to attempt to break the\r\n        world record in speed boating. His efforts at Coniston ended in\r\n        tragedy, however, as his boat left the water at high speed and broke\r\n        into several pieces on shore. Campbell?s body was never recovered.\r\n        Happier experiences were recorded by Arthur Ransom in his\r\n        book Swallows and Amazons (1930). The lake and its islands were his\r\n        inspiration for the story about the adventures of a group of children\r\n        who are left to their own devices one summer in an age when innocence\r\n        and security were taken for granted.\r\n        A pleasant way to enjoy the lake is to take a trip on the\r\n        Victorian steamer Gondola. The National Trust runs the boat, which\r\n        resembles the Venetian rowboats, and the plush interior takes one back\r\n        to the genteel times when tourism was just in its infancy, when this\r\n        steamer ride would have been just one part of a European ?Grand Tour. ?\r\n        The whole journey on this steamer takes about an hour.\r\n        One port of call for both Gondola and the other local boat\r\n        service, Coniston Launch, is Brantwood on the eastern shoreline. This\r\n        was the home of the 19th-century artist, critic, and reformer John\r\n        Ruskin, one of the preeminent men of his time. Author of over 250 books\r\n        and a prolific artist and art collector, he is perhaps best remembered\r\n        as a social theorist; in this century many prominent figures, including\r\n        Mahatma Gandhi, have been inspired by his writings. Ruskin lived at\r\n        Brantwood from 1872 until his death in 1900, and in that time the house\r\n        became a leading center of artistic and literary energy, much as\r\n        Wordsworth?s in Grasmere had just a few years before. Ruskin funded\r\n        educational programs on the role of women in society and research into\r\n        environmental pollution long before these issues became fashionable.\r\n        Sadly, he became mentally unstable in his later life and died a broken\r\n        man.\r\n        The house, which contains Ruskin?s study and examples of\r\n        his drawings and paintings, has magnificent views of the lake and the\r\n        town of Coniston. The gardens, laid out by Ruskin himself, cover nearly\r\n        one square kilometer (250 acres). Each year numerous exhibitions and\r\n        open-air performances are held on the estate, and a commercial gallery\r\n        on the grounds has an excellent selection of contemporary arts and\r\n        crafts.\r\n        The Langdale Fells\r\n        If you have limited time in the Lake District and want to\r\n        experience the high fells, do a little beginners-level hiking, or\r\n        simply drive through some breathtaking countryside, then this is the\r\n        place to visit. The Great Langdale and Little Langdale areas can be\r\n        said to be the true heart of the Lake District, lying as they do in the\r\n        very centre of the National Park. Interestingly enough, although\r\n        possibly the best loved landscape in the Lake District for walkers and\r\n        artists???Wordsworth described it as ?unity, austere but\r\n        reconciled,????there is not a lake in sight. Their beauty and\r\n        accessibility (being only a short drive from Ambleside) make them a\r\n        must for all visitors.\r\n        The initial approach route, along the A593 from Ambleside,\r\n        is characterized by rocky knolls rising from the valley bottoms. The\r\n        River Brathay runs alongside the main road, carrying water from the\r\n        fells that eventually flows into Lake Windermere. At Skelwith Bridge,\r\n        turn right on to the B5343. The road leaves the valley floor and takes\r\n        you past the small villages of Elterwater and Chapel Stile before\r\n        offering the first real views of the Langdale Fells. The beautiful\r\n        valleys and magnificent volcanic peaks???with such whimsical names as\r\n        Harrison Stickle and Crinkle Crags???produce some of the finest vistas\r\n        in the Lakes. No matter what the weather is like, the landscape is\r\n        dramatic and breathtaking. If there is only one place where you get out\r\n        of the car and do a little walking, this has to be it. Make a stop at\r\n        Blea Tarn, only about a ten-minute walk from the car park; this\r\n        beautiful body of water, surrounded by the high fells, offers one of\r\n        the most beautiful views in the National Park. On a quiet day you?ll\r\n        feel as if you have the world to yourself.\r\n        From Blea Tarn the road drops sharply down to a T-junction,\r\n        with signs right to Wrynose Pass. Take a left, towards the tiny village\r\n        of Little Langdale. You will need to take care here, as there may be\r\n        walkers on the road, especially at lunch time when everyone gathers in\r\n        the village for a ?pint? and a sandwich. Finally, once through the\r\n        village of Colwith, you will reach the main road, the A593, and a right\r\n        turn will lead you back to Ambleside.\r\n        Wrynose Pass and Hardknott Pass\r\n        West from Little Langdale toward the coast of the Irish\r\n        Sea, there is only a single route???and it is one that tests the nerve\r\n        of even the most experienced driver. The road climbs up through the\r\n        tree line and into bracken fell (plateaus with thickets of shrubs) and\r\n        sheep country until you reach the most difficult stretch of road in the\r\n        Lake District, over the passes of Wrynose and Hardknott.\r\n        Wrynose Pass comes first: a single-track road with\r\n        gradients of 1:4 will have you dodging sheep and other motorists around\r\n        blind bends. As the road climbs, though, it offers spectacular views\r\n        back to Little Langdale in the east; get out at the small car park at\r\n        the top of the pass and take photographs. The Three Shires Stone at the\r\n        roadside marks the meeting place of the historic shires of Lancashire,\r\n        Cumberland, and Westmoreland. The road then drops down to Wrynose\r\n        Bottom, a plain bereft of human life. The road shares the valley bottom\r\n        with the Duddon River, flowing west to the sea. The fell has an eerie\r\n        beauty about it; clouds frame the peaks here even on sunny days.\r\n        Hardknott Pass, with gradients of 1:3, is the mother of all\r\n        Lakeland passes; the road is narrow and steep and twists like a\r\n        switch-back ride. At the height of the season it can be choked with\r\n        traffic and there are few passing places. It?s a challenge, but many\r\n        say that you haven?t seen the Lakes unless you?ve traveled this road.\r\n        Try it early in the day when there?s much less traffic, or, if you\r\n        really don?t want to test your own driving skills, you can arrange for\r\n        an organized tour with a driver; contact the Cumbria Tourist Board for\r\n        more details (see page 125).\r\n        The Hardknott Castle Roman Fort, called Mediobogdum by its\r\n        builders, sits on a shelf near the summit of the pass. The thick walls\r\n        still clearly outline the fort?s boundaries. Take a walk around the\r\n        perimeter for breathtaking views of the valley below. Even on the\r\n        warmest day a stiff, cold breeze blows steadily up the fell. Just\r\n        imagine the kind of homesick letters a Roman-born legionnaire would\r\n        have written back home.\r\n        Eskdale\r\n        Once you make it over the high point of Hardknott Pass,\r\n        Eskdale opens up in front of you. It?s almost like catching sight of\r\n        Shangri-la: the vibrant green vall ey contrasts starkly with the\r\n        rust-colored high ground. High drystone walls curb the narrow roads and\r\n        rugged farmhouses nestle in the bottom of the valley. The tiny village\r\n        of Boot, two hundred yards from the main road, is the first sign of\r\n        civilization you?ll encounter after coming over the passes. The two\r\n        dozen or so houses???including some of the best self-catering lodgings\r\n        in the Lakes???are clustered in a peaceful setting surrounded by the\r\n        higher fells of Birker and Eskdale.\r\n        The Eskdale Corn Mill sits at the very top of the village,\r\n        over Pack Horse Bridge. This 16th-century mill is still powered by the\r\n        force of Whillan Beck, the water that comes racing down from the fells\r\n        above. There are many sign-posted walks from Boot into the surrounding\r\n        countryside, including a 3-km (2-mile) walk to the waterfalls of\r\n        Stanley Force across the valley.\r\n        A little way along from Boot you?ll find the terminus of\r\n        the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, or ?La?al Ratty,? as it?s\r\n        affectionately known. A 38-cm (15-in) narrow-gauge railway, it carries\r\n        a tiny engine and even smaller carriages through rolling countryside\r\n        towards the coast at Ravenglass. Opened in 1875 to carry iron, it been\r\n        operating as a recreational railway since 1960; a favorite with\r\n        railroad enthusiasts, it runs all year round.\r\n        Wast Water\r\n        The deepest of all the lakes at 75 m (250 ft), Wast Water\r\n        is bounded on the east side by steep slopes of gray scree (small loose\r\n        stones) that tumble into the watery depths, and on the west by\r\n        stretches of bracken. The lake itself lies in the shadow of several\r\n        high mountains, including Scafell Pike, the highest in England at 977 m\r\n        (3,205 ft).\r\n        This remote area is reached by a single long route from the\r\n        central lakes, at the end of which you?ll find the scattered buildings\r\n        of the village of Wasdale Head. The rocks in this territory are\r\n        volcanic and relatively young compared to the hills of the north. They\r\n        have produced a stark and uncompromising landscape, with few trees\r\n        breaking the lines of the mountain-tops. A total contrast to the pretty\r\n        rolling hills of Derewentwater and Grasmere, it is a stark beauty,\r\n        though no less alluring. On fine days the sunshine and shadows chase\r\n        constantly across the water and rocky wastes, but stormy fronts that\r\n        form in the Atlantic Ocean are caught by the mountain tops here, as a\r\n        result of which they are almost always enveloped in clouds.\r\n        Wasdale, the birthplace of British fell-walking, is still\r\n        very popular with experienced fell-walkers because its rocky crags give\r\n        access to some of the most challenging hiking in the Lakes. Many who\r\n        have their sights set on the Alps and Himalayas come to train on the\r\n        peaks in this area. There are few easy walks on the higher ground, but\r\n        around Wast Water and in the valley bottom you can enjoy footpaths that\r\n        offer panoramic views of the mountains. The Wasdale Head Inn is a\r\n        traditional meeting place, resting as it does in the lea of all the\r\n        sheer ascents. You?re bound to meet some hardy outdoor types in the\r\n        bar.\r\n        A curious competition is held in Wasdale each November. The\r\n        ?Biggest Liar in the World? Competition is an amateur ?story-telling?\r\n        contest open to all comers. Fishermen and anglers seem to have the edge\r\n        over most, but politicians and journalists are actually banned from\r\n        taking part, since they are regarded as professionals.\r\n        Ravenglass\r\n        The Lake District National Park encompasses a short area of\r\n        coastline where the tidal estuaries of the North Sea meet the streams\r\n        and rivers flowing down from the western lakes. The main settlement on\r\n        this coast is Ravenglass, a curious town of one main street with a\r\n        hundred or so neat cottages huddled together against the prevailing\r\n        winter winds. First settled by the Romans, it sits on a wide estuary\r\n        created by the confluence of three rivers. The Romans called their town\r\n        Clanoventa (?the town on the bank?). All that remains of the original\r\n        settlement are the ruins of a Roman bathhouse, just a little ways from\r\n        today?s town. Walk under the railway line and turn right down a farm\r\n        track. This is the headquarters of the Ravenglass and Eskdale\r\n        Railway???the little trains spend the night in the sidings here. The\r\n        station has a bar and a collection of railway memorabilia.\r\n        The tidal estuary harbors a number of islands that serve as\r\n        important breeding grounds for seabirds. It can be dangerous to explore\r\n        the open, sandy areas on these islands since the tides rise very\r\n        quickly; be sure to check the tidal tables before setting out.\r\n        Nearby is Muncaster Castle, a structure offering much in\r\n        the way of English history. Built on Roman foundations, the castle was\r\n        erected in the late 13th century to keep the Scots at bay???its\r\n        strategic position affords good views of the surrounding lowland. Since\r\n        the 13th century, the castle has been owned by the Pennington family,\r\n        who feel that their tenancy is protected by the terms of an ancient\r\n        royal gift. In 1464, after the Battle of Hexham, King Henry VI wandered\r\n        the countryside and many of the landowners, unsure whether he was\r\n        victor or vanquished, refused to give him shelter. Sir John Pennington,\r\n        however, invited him into Muncaster. When Henry returned to his duties\r\n        he gave his drinking bowl to the family, saying that as long as the cup\r\n        remained unbroken the family would remain at Muncaster. Needless to say\r\n        the bowl, which is still in one piece, is kept under lock and key at\r\n        all times.\r\n        Over the generations the castle has been expanded, but it\r\n        is still essentially a family home, full of furniture, books, and\r\n        family portraits. Visitors can tour the house with a tape-recorded\r\n        narrative that gives detailed information about each room. The 32\r\n        hectares (80 acres) of garden are equally pleasing. Rhododendrons and\r\n        other exotic plants imported from China during the 19th century have\r\n        created one of the finest gardens in northern England. The castle\r\n        grounds are also home to The Owl Centre, a conservancy devoted to\r\n        saving the 150 species of owl found around the world. Calling itself a\r\n        ?Noah?s ark for owls,? the Owl Centre hosts a bird flight event every\r\n        afternoon at 2:30.\r\n        Muncaster Mill, 3 km (2 miles) north of the castle, started\r\n        operating in 1455, although the present building dates from the 18th\r\n        century. It is still used to grind oatmeal and whole-wheat flour, which\r\n        is available for sale. The mill sits on the River Mite, and ?La?al\r\n        Ratty? makes a regular stop here.\r\n        Duddon Valley\r\n        The Duddon Valley and the rolling hillsides around the\r\n        village of Ulpha were much favored by Wordsworth. He wrote ?Sonnets on\r\n        the River Duddon? in praise of the area. This is true moorland???open\r\n        stretches of heath that contrast sharply with the high peaks in the\r\n        background. The views of Scafell and the Cumbrian Mountains from the\r\n        road that crosses Ulpha Fell (in the direction of Eskdale and Eskdale\r\n        Green) are splendid. And if you really cannot face the excitement and\r\n        exhilaration of crossing Wrynose and Hardknott passes, this road offers\r\n        a far less taxing way to reach the coast and the far west of the\r\n        Lakeland.\r\n        The Northeast\r\n        Boasting some of William Wordsworth?s favorite haunts as\r\n        well as an old Roman road that is now a very popular hiking route, the\r\n        Northeast is spectacular walking country, transitional terrain between\r\n        the Lake District?s high fells and peaks and the lowland passes around\r\n        Penrith and the Eden valley. These passes were used as a gateway to the\r\n        Lake District by armies of marauding Scots. All of these passes and\r\n        many kilometers of walking trails surround the region?s single (though\r\n        impressive) large lake???Ullswater. At the eastern reaches the high\r\n        ground gives way to undulating farmland.\r\n        Kirkstone Pass\r\n        Leading northeast from Lake Windermere to Ullswater,\r\n        Kirkstone Pass on the A592 is the highest in the Lakes???446 m (1,489\r\n        ft). The Kirkstone Inn, an old coach house and now local landmark, was\r\n        built here to shelter travelers on the hazardous trip between Penrith\r\n        and the central lakes area. Despite the high altitude, Kirkstone Pass\r\n        is in fact the easiest of the Lake District passes to traverse, since\r\n        the valley floor is very wide, even at the highest level. Watch for a\r\n        car park just beyond the summit, where you can stop and enjoy the\r\n        awe-inspiring view north over the diminutive Brothers Water, so called\r\n        because two brothers were said to have drowned in its depths.\r\n        The road then follows the valley bottom through the towns\r\n        of Patterdale and Glenridding. Both towns, once centers for mining, are\r\n        good starting points for walking, hiking, and pony trekking into the\r\n        surrounding fells and mountains.\r\n        Ullswater\r\n        Ullswater is the one major lake in the northeast corner of\r\n        the Lake District. At 12 km (71?2 miles) in length, it is the\r\n        second-largest lake after Windermere, but it does not have the\r\n        commercial development of its big brother and is far less busy. The\r\n        character of the lake changes as you travel along its length; the shape\r\n        of the valley constantly alters the perspective, a fact that has not\r\n        been overlooked by generations of painters and photographers. Many\r\n        people visit the area to take advantage of the water sports; it is\r\n        particularly popular with canoeists. Both Glenridding and Patterdale\r\n        offer boat rentals. The road from Ambleside to Penrith (A592) runs\r\n        along the length of the north shore. From here it is possible to stop\r\n        and admire the view. Those who don?t want to drive or walk around it\r\n        can take the ferry, which travels down the whole length of the lake\r\n        from Glenridding to Pooley Bridge.\r\n        Gowbarrow Park\r\n        Just beyond the turning for Dockray is Gowbarrow Park,\r\n        which rolls across the hillside above Ullswater. This is the spot where\r\n        Wordsworth?s sister Dorothy was stopped in her tracks by what she\r\n        believed were the most beautiful daffodils she had ever seen; her\r\n        astonishment inspired Wordsworth to write about this ?host of golden\r\n        Daffodils? in one of the best-loved poems of the English language, ?I\r\n        Wandered Lonely as a Cloud? (1804). The park is at its very best in\r\n        spring, when you can walk through a carpet of flowers surrounded by the\r\n        fresh green leaves of the newly awakened woodland.\r\n        Here you?ll also encounter one of the most popular\r\n        waterfalls in the Lake District. Beautiful at any time of year, Aira\r\n        Force is a 20-m (60-ft) waterfall spanned at its peak by a narrow stone\r\n        foot-bridge. It is a favorite subject for photographers, in part\r\n        because of the wonderful woodland setting with rare mosses and\r\n        fantastic Monkey Puzzle trees. The car park from the A5091 offers the\r\n        shortest route to the falls.\r\n        At the northern tip of Ullswater there is a right turn to\r\n        Pooley Bridge, the northernmost stop for the lake steamer. The road\r\n        leads farther along the eastern shore of the lake to Martindale with\r\n        its pretty Elizabethan church, St. Martin. Though the road eventually\r\n        reaches a dead end, there are a number of marked hiking routes back\r\n        towards Ullswater or south over higher ground to Patterdale. About 3 km\r\n        (2 miles) farther down the road is the Sharrow Bay Hotel, the first and\r\n        arguably still the best country-house hotel in the Lake District. Try\r\n        lunch or afternoon tea on the terrace.\r\n        Dalemain Country House\r\n        This distinguished house is remarkable for its longevity\r\n        and conglomeration of architectural styles. Behind the fine Georgian\r\n        fa?ade, made of local sandstone, is a genuine Tudor structure\r\n        (including the Fretwork Room, with its magnificent 16th-century oak\r\n        paneling), a manor hall dating from 1400 (which now houses the\r\n        restaurant/caf?), and a Norman pele tower. In the 12th century, when\r\n        the house consisted of little more than the pele tower, it was owned by\r\n        the de Morville family (one of the more infamous members of this\r\n        family, Hugh de Morville, was one of the four knights who murdered\r\n        Thomas ? Becket in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170). Since 1679 it has\r\n        been owned by the Hasell family, who built the Georgian extension, and\r\n        who over the generations have carefully managed the treasures that fill\r\n        the house. Visitors today can examine the traces of the house?s\r\n        complicated architectural legacy and explore such fascinating\r\n        historical oddities as the ?priest?s hiding hole,? built during the\r\n        Reformation as an emergency escape route for Catholic priests who had\r\n        been invited in to say Mass. Access to the chapel and the hiding hole\r\n        was through the fireplace, which would be lit to help confound\r\n        pursuers. There are also a number of museums in the magnificent\r\n        grounds, including a Fell Pony Museum and the Yeoman?s Museum.\r\n        Rheged\r\n        This attraction, an amazing adventure in an ancient kingdom\r\n        opened during the summer of 1999, and offers a chance to take a journey\r\n        through the history of Cumbria. There are displays, exhibitions, and a\r\n        massive multi-screen cinema experience, complimented by speciality\r\n        shops, restaurants, caf?s, and an indoor play center. All this is in a\r\n        fantastic five-story building in the middle of an old quarry. The roof\r\n        is covered in grass, making it the largest earth covered building in\r\n        Britain.\r\n        Penrith\r\n        The gateway to the Lake District for those traveling from\r\n        the north, Penrith was often at the center of battles between the\r\n        English and the Scots for control of this frontier territory. The town\r\n        center is a curious tangle of winding streets, laid out that way, some\r\n        say, to confound enemies. The many little alleys, or ?yards,? as\r\n        they?re called, were used to protect herds of sheep brought down from\r\n        the fells during times of crisis. Today it is a thriving market town,\r\n        not yet in the full grip of the tourist boom. The lively cattle market\r\n        makes Penrith a center for the economic activity of the area. The\r\n        Tourist Information Centre and a small town museum are housed in a\r\n        plain, sturdy building from Elizabethan times known as Robinson?s\r\n        School. Above the town, across from the railway station, are the\r\n        remains of Penrith Castle, built to protect against raids from the\r\n        north. Traditional home of the Neville family, the castle fell into\r\n        royal possession after a series of skirmishes. King Edward IV granted\r\n        the castle and land to Richard of Gloucester???who later became King\r\n        Richard III???and it stood as a bastion of the English crown. Later, as\r\n        it fell into disrepair, the walls were dismantled and used to build\r\n        other structures in the town. You can see the characteristic red stone\r\n        on almost every street.\r\n        Askham\r\n        South of Penrith is an area of farmland that forms the\r\n        eastern boundary of the National Park. With its wealth of pretty\r\n        cottages, Askham is a true farming community. The long village green is\r\n        a wonderful place for a stroll, and an even better place to take a\r\n        break, thanks to number of good pubs. A little way from Askham village\r\n        is Lowther Park. This large estate once centered on a fairy-tale\r\n        castle, the remains of which can still be seen from the outside (it?s\r\n        not open to the public). The vast grounds have been turned into a\r\n        leisure park (open summer only) which has more than forty attractions.\r\n        Set in grassland and rolling countryside is a deer park, a bird-of-prey\r\n        attraction, a circus, and a theme park. There?s lots for children to\r\n        do, and there are some wonderful spaces for secluded picnics.\r\n        Haweswater\r\n        This windswept area of water is close to the central lakes\r\n        as the crow flies, but it takes a long time to reach by car. Many\r\n        people walk the distance, using High Street, the path of an old Roman\r\n        road that cuts across the fell tops from Lake Windermere toward\r\n        Penrith. Gentler footpaths radiate from it on to the vast commons of\r\n        Brampton and Martindale, but the main part of this route is not for the\r\n        inexperienced or the unfit.\r\n        The Haweswater that you see today is man-made. The 61?2-km\r\n        (4-mile) long reservoir was created in 1941. The road travels to the\r\n        head of the reservoir, and footpaths lead through wonderful undulating\r\n        countryside all around the lake and onto Mardale Common. The area gets\r\n        crowded in summer, partly due to interest in the nesting golden eagles,\r\n        which have been returned to the area because of the efforts of\r\n        environmentalists. There are no facilities here, so bring food and\r\n        drink with you.\r\n        Caldbeck\r\n        The northernmost village in the National Park and once a\r\n        mining town, Caldbeck, with its pa stel cottages on either side of\r\n        Chalk Beck, is now rather sleepy. The only remaining evidence of\r\n        industry is Priests Mill, which has been a corn mill, a bobbin mill,\r\n        and a sawmill. The water wheel and sluice gate still operate in summer,\r\n        and there is a small display of artifacts used over the years; the mill\r\n        buildings themselves have been converted to a gift shop and caf?. In\r\n        the churchyard of St. Kentigern church, opposite the mill, is the grave\r\n        of John Peel. A landowner and leader of the local hunt, Peel was a\r\n        larger-than-life character, well known throughout the region in his\r\n        day. One of his friends, the poet Robert Graves, wrote a poem about his\r\n        antics. The verses were set to music in the mid-19th century and since\r\n        then the song ?D?ye Ken John Peel? have been taught in every English\r\n        school. You will also find the grave of the ?Beauty of Buttermere?\r\n        nearby (see page 72).\r\n        The Northwest\r\n        With forests and fells, a valley of breathtaking beauty,\r\n        and the most spectacular lake setting in the National Park, this area\r\n        has a greater variety of views than any other in the Lake District.\r\n        Keswick\r\n        This town of sturdy Victorian houses made of gray Lakeland\r\n        stone has a stunning setting, nestled as it is in a natural bowl on the\r\n        shores of Derwentwater and surrounded by green hills. The biggest town\r\n        in the National Park, the population of Keswick (pronounced ?kezzick?)\r\n        swells each summer as hikers, boaters, and sightseers arrive. Keswick\r\n        makes a good base for touring the National Park and the Northwest. A\r\n        working town through much of its history, with the wool and mining\r\n        industries as major employers, Keswick also aroused the interest of\r\n        writers and artists. Coleridge and Southey, two of the more prominent\r\n        Lake Poets, both lived here and raised the profile of the town and the\r\n        surrounding area. Greta Hall, once the home of Southey and his family\r\n        and now part of Keswick School, is unfortunately not open to the\r\n        public. Moot Hall, a slate structure built in the early 19th century\r\n        and used for Church of England services when the community had no\r\n        church, sits in the center of town surrounded by the bustle of small\r\n        shops and, on Saturdays, market stalls. You will find the tourist\r\n        information center here. Century Theatre offers a program of\r\n        performances ranging from drama to Gilbert and Sullivan to English\r\n        pantomime. Originally a traveling group, the company has found a\r\n        permanent home in Keswick. The box office is next to the Tourist\r\n        Information Centre.\r\n        The Cumberland Pencil Factory, a leading producer of\r\n        pencils in the world, would appear to have little to offer the visitor,\r\n        but the Pencil Museum provides fascinating insights into the history of\r\n        pencil production in the area. It all began in the 15th century, when\r\n        an important seam of graphite was found in neighboring Borrowdale.\r\n        There are displays and videos, including excerpts of the famous video,\r\n        The Snowman, which was produced???as were the original book\r\n        illustrations???using Cumberland?s Derwent line of color pencils.\r\n        Visitors also learn how Cumberland pencils helped some prisoners escape\r\n        from Nazi Germany during World War II. When entering the museum,\r\n        children are offered worksheets that keep them busy seeking out\r\n        information from displays and diagrams; they seem to relish the\r\n        challenge, as do many of the parents. At the back of the exhibit is an\r\n        area set aside for activities such as drawing, brass rubbing, and\r\n        finger painting.\r\n        The Keswick Museum and Art Gallery in Fitz Park is a\r\n        treasure trove of artifacts collected in the area, with the atmosphere\r\n        of an old professor?s study. A collection of stuffed birds and\r\n        preserved butterflies sits alongside rock samples and Stone Age axes.\r\n        Perhaps the greatest collection is housed in the small Art Gallery. A\r\n        series of neat wooden display cases hold manuscripts and personal\r\n        articles of the luminaries of the Lakeland region???scripts from the\r\n        hand of Robert Southey and letters written by Ruskin along with objects\r\n        such as their tea cups, clogs, and purses.\r\n        Fitz Park itself is a fine example of the philanthropic\r\n        attitude of the Victorians, who created green spaces in almost every\r\n        town for the people to enjoy. Although many parks around the country\r\n        have been allowed to fall into decay, Keswick has kept its park tidy\r\n        and in good repair, with neat flower beds and pretty borders.\r\n        Castlerigg Stone Circle\r\n        Just above Keswick, sitting in the shadow of the mighty\r\n        Blencathra, or ?Saddleback,? mountain to the north, is a late\r\n        Neolithic/early Bronze Age circle of 48 stones. Its impressive setting\r\n        on a rounded hill just below the high peaks and out of sight of modern\r\n        buildings allows the visitor to gain an impression of times past, when\r\n        the circle was used in ancient and mysterious rituals.\r\n        Derwent Water\r\n        Its wooded shores, delightful islands, and beautiful\r\n        setting have earned Derwent Water the epithet ?Queen of the Lakes. ? At\r\n        just 5 km (3 miles) in length it is more manageable than some of the\r\n        larger lakes. Surrounded by rounded fells rather than high mountains,\r\n        the countryside here is restful rather than challenging, and the\r\n        walking is easy. Footpaths along the water?s edge lead to pretty wooden\r\n        bridges and reed beds, which are home to a wealth of bird and water\r\n        life. In the distance are Skiddaw Peak to the north and Cat Bells in\r\n        the west.\r\n        Lakeside is just a five-minute walk from Keswick, via a\r\n        footpath that leads along the shore line. This is where the Derwent\r\n        Water ferry moors. The lake ferry provides a relaxing way to take in\r\n        the beautiful setting and get a closer look at some of the islands. If\r\n        you feel more energetic, you can rent a rowboat at the dock and set out\r\n        under your own steam. St. Herbert?s Island was named after the saint\r\n        who lived here as a hermit; after his death in 687 it became a place of\r\n        pilgrimage.\r\n        On the northwest shore of the lake is Lingolm, historic\r\n        home of Lord Rochdale. Beatrix Potter spent many happy holidays here as\r\n        a child with her parents, who were friends of Rochdale. It was during\r\n        these holidays that her love of the Lake District was born. The house\r\n        is famed for its gardens???particularly its rhododendrons, which were\r\n        highly prized at the end of the 19th century???and its beautiful\r\n        setting; from here you can marvel at panoramic views of the lake and\r\n        Skiddaw Peak and Blenthcathra beyond.\r\n        The B5289 road, which runs south from Keswick along the\r\n        eastern shore of Derwent Water, leads you to some of the best gems of\r\n        the Lake District. It?s worth taking a day?s drive or a few days of\r\n        walking to seek them out. After leaving Keswick, the road finds the\r\n        lake?s edge and leads you to wonderful views of Cat Bells peak on the\r\n        western bank. Your eye will be drawn right, but be sure not to miss the\r\n        left junction at the sign for Watendlath. Take this small road, which\r\n        climbs up through wooded hillsides; about a kilometer (1?2?mile) from\r\n        the main road is Ashness Bridge, a tiny stone bridge spanning a modest\r\n        little beck. It?s become very popular, though, because from it you can\r\n        enjoy a splendid view of Derwent Water and the fells???it?s an almost\r\n        perfectly framed natural composition, something no photographer,\r\n        professional or amateur, can resist.\r\n        A few kilometers farther south you?ll come upon ?Surprise\r\n        View,? a lookout that offers a panoramic vista of Derwent Water with\r\n        Bassenthwaite Lake in the distance. It?s an awe-inspiring sight, but\r\n        beware of the sheer drop, especially on a windy day. As the road climbs\r\n        higher you?ll reach a hidden valley, left behind as the glaciers of the\r\n        Ice Age melted. Watendlath, Norse for ?the barn at the end of the\r\n        water,? is one of the best places to enjoy the stark fell landscape\r\n        without much exertion. The walks lie along the stream bed on a plateau\r\n        high above Derwent Water. The tiny village of Watendlath is\r\n        beautiful???a small farming community beside a small tarn, set in a\r\n        natural bowl surrounded by stark fells, it seems to lie far away from\r\n        the 20th century. Travel over the 15th-century pack-horse bridge to\r\n        reach footpaths that lead to the surrounding valleys. It?s difficult to\r\n        believe that this little spot was once a major junction for traffic in\r\n        the lakes before motorized vehicles were invented. For a wonderful\r\n        afternoon walk of about 10 km (6 miles) you can leave your car at\r\n        Ashness Bridge and walk up along the path of the beck to\r\n        Watendlath.\r\n        Return to the B5289 and continue toward the southern tip\r\n        of Derwent Water. In the Lodore area, it?s worth taking a detour to see\r\n        Lodore Falls, situated behind the Lodore Hotel. The impact that the\r\n        falls make will depend to a certain extent on what kind of weather the\r\n        area has been experiencing: after a spell of rain they?re a spectacular\r\n        torrent, but in dry weather the flow can slow to a mere trickle. Park\r\n        in the Kettlewell car park, which is just beyond the Watendlath\r\n        turn-off.\r\n        Borrowdale\r\n        The B5289 moves along the shores of Derwent Water and then\r\n        follows the beautiful green valley of the River Derwent, where families\r\n        gather to swim and picnic. This is Borrowdale, the most famous valley\r\n        in the Lake District. The twin span bridge at Grange marks the start of\r\n        the valley. Filled with deciduous woodland, green fields, small\r\n        villages, and farmhouses, this is the epitome of northern English\r\n        landscape.\r\n        Near the village of Rosthwaite is the Bowder Stone, a\r\n        giant lump of rock left behind by glacial ice that receded at a very\r\n        slow pace. It?s said to weigh 2,000 tons (1.8 million?kg/4 million\r\n        pounds). Standing on a small, narrow base in a gully surrounded by\r\n        trees, it looks like an upside-down iceberg. The stone was much loved\r\n        by Victorian visitors, who would have their photographs taken with\r\n        hands outstretched against the rock face, as if to show that they were\r\n        strong enough to hold up the massive stone.\r\n        Just before the village of Seatoller is a junction with a\r\n        sign for Seathwaite, said to be the wettest settlement in Britain. The\r\n        rainfall recorded here is almost one third more than in nearby valleys;\r\n        since the actual number of rainy days is no higher for Seathwaite, it?s\r\n        believed that it must be the setting of the village that accounts for\r\n        the higher volume. Seathwaite is the gateway to Scafell Pike (a\r\n        6-km/4-mile footpath connects them), and the mountain may attract more\r\n        clouds and more intense rain than other peaks in the lakes.\r\n        Seatoller village is home to the Seatoller National Park\r\n        Visitor Centre. From here the road turns out of the Borrowdale valley\r\n        to begin a steep ascent westward through Honister Pass. This is one of\r\n        the most difficult passes to ascend, but also, arguably, the prettiest.\r\n        Grey scree slopes dominate both sides of the pass, which only sheep\r\n        seem to be able to move across with ease. The narrow view creates a\r\n        tunnel effect???the eye is drawn directly ahead towards the peaks of\r\n        High Stile and Red Pike, which cradle the lake and village of\r\n        Buttermere.\r\n        Buttermere\r\n        Buttermere is one of the pearls of the Lake district.\r\n        Small and accessible, it is possible to walk around its shoreline in a\r\n        couple of hours. Most of the route is relatively flat and all of it is\r\n        picturesque. The small copse planted here has created a photographer?s\r\n        delight. Water, hills, and trees combine to offer some of the most\r\n        memorable views in the National Park. Buttermere Lake is one of the\r\n        homes of Lake District char, relatives of the salmon that were trapped\r\n        here by the changes in sea and land levels after the last Ice Age.\r\n        The tiny village of Buttermere has a number of restaurants\r\n        and caf?s that are good for lunch. It?s a popular little spot, though,\r\n        so there are usually problems with parking on all but the quietest\r\n        weekends. The village was made famous in the 19th century, when a\r\n        writer named J. Budworth encountered Mary Robinson, the beautiful\r\n        daughter of the landlord of the Fish Inn. In his book A Fortnight?s\r\n        Ramble in the Lakes Budworth christened her the ?Beauty of Buttermere.\r\n        ? For years after the book was published, devoted (and curious) readers\r\n        came from all around to see this beauty for themselves. Mary succumbed\r\n        to all the attention and was swept off her feet by one these admirers,\r\n        a certain Colonel Hope M.P. Despite his exalted station, the good\r\n        Colonel turned out to be an imposter and a bigamist, and after their\r\n        marriage was sent to jail. But Mary managed to make a new life for\r\n        herself with a local man, and gave birth to seven children. She is\r\n        buried in Caldbeck (see page 63).\r\n        Just a little farther along the valley to the northwest,\r\n        joined to Buttermere by a stream, lie two other lakes. Crummock Water\r\n        lies in the shadow of dramatic Mellbreak Peak. From its western shore\r\n        you can gain access to Scale Force, at 60 m (170 ft) the highest\r\n        waterfall in the Lake District. It is 3 km (2 miles) to the falls by\r\n        footpath from Buttermere village. Loweswater is the smallest of the\r\n        three lakes and never crowded. With footpath access and picnic sites,\r\n        it makes a restful place to spend an afternoon.\r\n        Bassenthwaite Lake\r\n        Bassenthwaite Lake, just under 6 km (4 miles) in length,\r\n        lies to the northwest of Keswick. It proved to be an inspiration to\r\n        Alfred Lord Tennyson when he was writing his poem ?Morte d?Arthur. ?\r\n        Tennyson?s description of the lake into which an anguished Arthur\r\n        throws his sword Excalibur is based on Bassenthwaite. At the time the\r\n        poet was staying on the eastern shore at Mirehouse, the imposing family\r\n        residence of his friend James Spedding. The house is now open to the\r\n        public, with limited hours. Its large garden has a number of different\r\n        environments, from a formal herb garden to open pasture land. On the\r\n        grounds is the tiny Church of St. Begas, which is always left open for\r\n        travelers. Public footpaths link the gardens with Dodd Woods and the\r\n        peak of Skiddaw behind.\r\n        Bassenthwaite is not as frequently visited as some of the\r\n        other lakes???there is no ferry service and water activities are\r\n        restricted. It is well known by anglers, however, who value it for its\r\n        good supplies of sport fish, such as char.\r\n        The village of Bassenthwaite spreads out across the valley\r\n        to the north of the lake. Trotters and Friends Animal Farm was a\r\n        working farm that now opens its doors to visitors and offers\r\n        opportunities to feed, pet, and pick up the animals. Some of the\r\n        creatures here are decidedly exotic???including lizards and\r\n        snakes???but others are old Lakeland favorites, like Herdwich sheep and\r\n        native cows and pigs that can be found all across the countryside.\r\n        Animal feeding takes place every day during the summer and there are\r\n        also tractor rides, weather permitting. With a caf? and picnic area,\r\n        it?s a great place for children of all ages.\r\n        Skiddaw\r\n        At 931 m (3054 ft) Skiddaw is one of the major peaks of\r\n        the northern Lakeland area, and one of the three highest in England.\r\n        Its rounded form testifies to the fact that it is also one of the\r\n        oldest. The whole mountain was once blanketed in forest and designated\r\n        as a royal hunting area. In the 19th century it was a favorite haunt of\r\n        Coleridge and other English Romantics. It is the easiest of the big\r\n        peaks to climb, but the effort will still take up an entire day. The\r\n        car park near Ormathwaite is the best place to start. Or, for a\r\n        somewhat easier ascent, you could try scaling Latrigg, another peak a\r\n        few kilometers to the south, closer to Keswick. This climb offers\r\n        panoramic views of Derwentwater and Borrowdale.\r\n        Whinlatter Pass\r\n        There are two roads to Cockermouth in the far northwest\r\n        corner of the Lake District. The fast road travels the length of the\r\n        eastern shore of Bassenthwaite Lake; the slower, and more picturesque,\r\n        route leads through Whinlatter Forest. This dense pine forest looks\r\n        spectacular against a blue summer sky, and there are picnic sites and\r\n        trails through the trees. The Whinlatter Pass Visitor Centre is a hub\r\n        for many cycle paths and walks.\r\n        Cockermouth\r\n        A no-nonsense working town with a wide tree-lined main\r\n        street and pastel painted houses, Cockermouth has an air of quiet\r\n        gentility. There is still a regular cattle market here for the farmers\r\n        from the surrounding countryside. The main attractions are linked to\r\n        the town?s most prominent son, William Wordsworth, who was born here in\r\n        1770. The Wordsworth House on Main Street origina lly belonged to local\r\n        landowner Sir James Lowther; the poet?s father John Wordsworth was\r\n        Lowther?s land agent. William lived here until the tragic death of his\r\n        mother in 1778, when he was sent to school in Hawkshead. The elegant\r\n        Georgian building has several rooms furnished in the 18th-century\r\n        style; on display are a number of articles that belonged to Wordsworth\r\n        himself. At the back of the house is a walled terraced garden.\r\n        Just a few yards away is the Trout Hotel (once a private\r\n        house), which has a connection with a more recent celebrity. Bing\r\n        Crosby stayed here???in room 18 to be exact???on one of his trips to\r\n        England; he used it as a base for a few days of fly-fishing. The hotel\r\n        is a fascinating amalgamation of architectural styles, with the front\r\n        section, which houses the cozy bars, being the oldest, dating from\r\n        around 1670. You can arrange fishing trips through the hotel and\r\n        lessons during the season.\r\n        The Working Museum of Printing is also on Main Street; the\r\n        entrance is through the Printing House shop. This museum documents the\r\n        history of printing and displays many beautiful and rare manual\r\n        printing machines dating from the early 1800?s. More recent machines\r\n        saved from destruction include the Linotype printers used to produce\r\n        newspapers until the advent of digital presses.\r\n        Across the river from town is the Jennings Brewery, one of\r\n        the few remaining independent brewers in the area. It supplies many of\r\n        the pubs in the Lake District???you?re sure to see the brewery name on\r\n        many pub signs. Beer is still brewed by traditional methods here. The\r\n        brewery runs a regular guided tour, which offers information both about\r\n        the brewing of beer and about the historic brewery buildings, which\r\n        stand in the shadow of the ruined Cockermouth Castle. Also on the same\r\n        site are a Motor Museum and the Cumberland Toy and Model Museum, which\r\n        celebrates 100 years of British toy making. Train sets and racing car\r\n        tracks will bring back childhood memories for many.\r\n        Cockermouth has some fascinating little shops. The\r\n        Courthouse Antiques and Craft Market, next to Cocker Bridge, makes an\r\n        interesting diversion and gives you the opportunity to purchase unusual\r\n        souvenirs. Antique pieces and collectibles fill every nook and\r\n        cranny.\r\n        Just outside town, on the A5086, is the Lakeland Sheep and\r\n        Wool Centre, where you can meet the woolly creatures of the fells up\r\n        close. The staff can introduce you to 19 of the over 150 breeds of\r\n        sheep. They also regularly hold sheep dog and sheep-shearing\r\n        demonstrations, all in a covered auditorium, which allows you to watch\r\n        the shepherds at work without having to stand out on the hillsides. You\r\n        will also find the Cumwest Exhibition here, which tells the story of\r\n        the Western Lakes, the lesser known though no less captivating part of\r\n        the Lake District.\r\n        Thirlmere\r\n        The A591???the main route north between Ambleside and\r\n        Keswick???passes the Thirlmere reservoir, which opened in 1894. There\r\n        was a great outcry when the city of Manchester to the southeast\r\n        developed the lake as a reservoir for its swelling population. There\r\n        were originally two lakes here, as well as a pretty village in the\r\n        valley. The water company dammed the northern lake, which raised the\r\n        water level and flooded the village (only after the villagers had been\r\n        resettled, of course). The main road skirts the eastern side of the\r\n        lake; the minor route on the west bank, however, is prettier, affording\r\n        dramatic views of Helvellyn Peak in the distance. Helvellyn, 965 m\r\n        (3116 ft) high, is one of the most popular peaks in the country and\r\n        forms part of the traditional ?Three Peaks Challenge,? a 60-km\r\n        (40-mile) run over the three highest peaks in England???Helvellyn,\r\n        Scafell Pike, and Skiddaw. You?ll always meet fellow ramblers on\r\n        Helvellyn who?ll keep your spirits up if you begin to flag on the\r\n        ascent.\r\n        Day Trips From The Lake District\r\n        Gretna Green\r\n        About an hour from the Lakes via the M6 is the Scottish\r\n        village of Gretna Green, which is famous throughout the land for one\r\n        thing: weddings. In 1753, new legislation in England made it illegal\r\n        for anyone under the age of 21 to marry without the consent of their\r\n        parents or legal guardians. This act did not apply in Scotland,\r\n        however, where 16 remained the age of consent, so many young couples\r\n        took to eloping to Scotland, and most stopped to tie the knot in Gretna\r\n        Green, the nearest town over the border.\r\n        The blacksmith?s shop in the center of the village became\r\n        the focus of this activity because it was the blacksmith who often\r\n        officiated at these ceremonies, striking his anvil with a hammer to\r\n        signify that the union was official. Getting married ?over the anvil?\r\n        soon became a stock phrase used to refer to the marriage of young\r\n        couples. Although the laws on marriage changed over the years, the\r\n        anvil weddings continued, still performed by the amiable blacksmith.\r\n        Pressure from the church and state eventually forced a ban on anvil\r\n        weddings, in 1940. Today couples who are nostalgic for the more\r\n        romantic days of Gretna Green?s past still come to The Old Blacksmith?s\r\n        Shop to exchange their vows, though they now participate in a legal\r\n        marriage ceremony. Visitors to the center can view the marriage room,\r\n        complete with anvil, along with a small museum that has preserved the\r\n        tales of angry parents who descended on the shop to interrupt weddings\r\n        in progress. You may be lucky enough to see a wedding yourself. If not,\r\n        the complex has other diversions, including caf?s and a number of shops\r\n        selling Scottish products from tartan and tweed to whisky.\r\n        To reach Gretna Green, take the M6 north from Penrith.\r\n        This motorway turns in to A74 and then into the A74(M), Gretna Green is\r\n        2 km (1 mile) from junction 2 of the A74(M).\r\n        Blackpool\r\n        Blackpool has been considered the premier seaside resort\r\n        in Britain since Victorian times, attracting families from the northern\r\n        mill towns for fresh air and fun. The town capitalized on its\r\n        popularity by creating a modern resort full of almost nonstop\r\n        entertainment. The ?golden mile? of the sea-front promenade is packed\r\n        with people on summer days. Tram lines laid down at the end of the 19th\r\n        century still carry old trams for those who prefer to ride rather than\r\n        walk. Candy floss (cotton candy), Blackpool rock (a hard sugar\r\n        confection), and tacky souvenirs are sold in the many shops that line\r\n        the promenade: dare yourself to wear a ?Kiss me Quick? hat!\r\n        The most prominent site in Blackpool is the Tower, opened\r\n        in 1849; some think it served as the inspiration for Tour d?Eiffel in\r\n        Paris. Take a lift to the top for panoramic views over the town and the\r\n        sea, or enjoy a genteel tea dance in the ballroom with its ornate\r\n        chandelier and Wurlitzer organ.\r\n        Children can play on the never-ending sandy beach or take\r\n        a ride on a donkey, a seaside tradition for generations of English\r\n        children. For something a little more modern, stop to explore the\r\n        largest fun fair in the UK, Blackpool Pleasure Beach. In the fall\r\n        Blackpool comes alive with thousands of colored lights that create\r\n        fanciful pictures and patterns on the sea front. The ?illuminations,?\r\n        as they?re called, annually draw crowds of thousands, with cars\r\n        cruising the shore road to watch the show.\r\n        To reach Blackpool, take the M6 south from Kendal\r\n        (junction 36) until you reach the M55 at junction 32, approximately 30\r\n        km (20 miles) away. Take the M55, which will lead you to the outskirts\r\n        of Blackpool, then follow signs for town center.\r\n        Hadrian?s Wall\r\n        When the Roman legions marched into England, they made\r\n        their way steadily northward until they met with the might of the\r\n        Scottish Picts. These fierce warriors managed to halt the Roman\r\n        advance, and a prolonged pitched battle ensued in this borderland. In\r\n        122 a.d. the Emperor Hadrian visited Britain and ordered that a\r\n        defensive wall be built from coast to coast across this territory.\r\n        Though the Romans occasionally made forays to the north of the wall,\r\n        this line of fortifications would prove to be the northernmost border\r\n        of the Roman Empire. It runs some 112 km (70 miles) from\r\n        Bowness-on-Solway north of Carlisle in the west, to Wallsend, just\r\n        north of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in the east.\r\n        When the Romans abandoned England at the end of the fourth\r\n        century a.d. , Hadrian?s Wall fell into disrepair. Recently designated\r\n        a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, the wall has been the subject of a\r\n        great deal of study, and a great number of excavations are now under\r\n        way all along its path. Many of the remaining intact sections of the\r\n        wall are now on private land and inaccessible to the public. At\r\n        Birdoswald Visitors Centre, however, 24 km (15 miles) east of Carlisle,\r\n        visitors can view the remains of one of the forts and walk along some\r\n        of the better-preserved sections of the wall. The information center,\r\n        which serves as a base for archaeologists working at the site, has a\r\n        number of interesting displays about the history of the wall.\r\n        To reach Hadrian?s Wall and Birdoswald Visitors Centre,\r\n        take the M6 north from Penrith. Leave the motorway at junction 43 and\r\n        take the A69 east. This will take you through the town of Brampton and\r\n        on to the village of Greenhead. Take a left turn here on the B6318 and\r\n        after 6 km (4 miles) you will see the sign for Birdoswald.\r\n        Settle-to-Carlisle Railway\r\n        In the mid-19th century the creation of a network of\r\n        railway lines revolutionized transport and communications in England.\r\n        Extending these new lines into remote areas involved vast expense and\r\n        remarkable feats of engineering. Although many passenger lines have\r\n        gone out of use as the railroad declined in importance, one line in\r\n        particular has been kept in operation, primarily because it travels\r\n        through some of the most beautiful countryside in Britain. This line\r\n        runs from Carlisle, the county town of Cumbria, to Settle, a small\r\n        market town in the neighboring county of North Yorkshire. Passengers\r\n        can see spectacular views of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and the\r\n        Eden Valley and then spend some time wandering among the historic stone\r\n        buildings and the antiques and curio shops of Settle.\r\n        On summer weekends, the Railway runs a service with formal\r\n        lunch???a very refined way to take in the sights. Contact The\r\n        Settle-Carlisle Information Line, Tel. 066 066 0607 or Cumbria Journey\r\n        Planner, Tel. (01228) 606000 for more details.\r\n        To reach Carlisle, take the M6 north from Penrith, make an\r\n        exit at junction 43, and take the A69 road left towards Carlisle city\r\n        center.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n
