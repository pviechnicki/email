In praising John Frankenheimer's earlier works, Ross is\r\nmuch too gripped by a childish auteuristic fascination with the technical\r\naspects of what are very minor works. And his appraisal of actors and acting is\r\nshockingly amateurish. It is amusing that he could mistake Brando's ludicrous\r\nand perfunctory posturing as some controlled experiment in caricature and\r\nparody, but the homoerotic slavering over Val Kilmer is infantile and\r\nunbecoming of anyone who is supposed to make informed aesthetic judgments. One\r\nwould think a magazine like Slate would hire a film commentator who has\r\nsomething other than breezy pop-cultural enthusiasms to offer.\r\n\r\n            --Alex\r\nKhan\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Pointless\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Huh?\r\nCould Ann Hulbert's review of Joan Didion's latest novel (\"The Last Thing We\r\nExpected\") be any more convoluted? Hulbert takes Didion to task for writing\r\nstories that go nowhere. I think Hulbert likes Didion's new work.\r\nUnfortunately, her review reads like any one of Didion's earlier novels, dense\r\non prose, short on directness. If Hulbert has a point to make, she missed\r\nmaking it. I think I'll buy the book and take my chances.\r\n\r\n            --Ted\r\nHopper\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Property\r\nRights\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The premise of \"The Norplant\r\nOption,\" by Stuart Taylor Jr., reminds me of the plan my township put into\r\neffect in the mid-'70s to protect and preserve prime farmland by purchasing the\r\ndevelopment rights.\r\n\r\n            This concept was picked up in\r\nthe Clean Air Act: Polluters who reduce their toxic output beyond requirements\r\ncan sell the right to molest the environment to others less willing or less\r\nable to control emissions.\r\n\r\n            Taylor proposes that\r\nteen-agers on welfare be paid to use an implanted device to prevent pregnancy.\r\nIn effect, he suggests the government purchase reproductive rights, at least\r\nfor a limited time.\r\n\r\n            Since wage\r\nslavery is a well-established phenomenon, and getting better established by the\r\nday, a little nonreproduction bribery sounds pretty mainstream. Our loyal\r\nopposition on the right used to tell us that \"a man can do anything with his\r\nproperty.\" (Land-use regulation is a plot by Commies.) Isn't a woman's body her\r\nmost personal property? Can't she do with it what she will?\r\n\r\n            --Paul\r\nSilver\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Sexual\r\nExperimentation\r\n            \r\n\r\n            I believe we would probably\r\nbe justified in experimenting with the initiative outlined in \"The Norplant\r\nOption,\" by Stuart Taylor Jr., in a limited and controlled way. At the same\r\ntime, I am struck by what I find to be considerable conceptual confusion as\r\nwell as an absence of fundamental analysis based on solid biology and\r\nsociology.\r\n\r\n            The initiative is, in fact,\r\nan intrusion by the government upon the individual. True, the government\r\nalready makes or withholds payments based on a number of individual conditions,\r\nincluding the birth of a child, etc. However, there is a quantum leap in\r\nintrusion levels when payments are made based on something that is put under\r\npeople's skin.\r\n\r\n            Coercion is inevitable. The\r\nargument that beneficiaries will get paid more rather than less for something\r\nis disingenuous: They will be paid less than would otherwise be the case if\r\nthey refuse to submit, a point that no doubt will be made by many program\r\nadministrators.\r\n\r\n            More fundamentally, the\r\ndebate seems to ignore the biological forces at work. While underclass\r\nteen-agers may consciously have no interest other than in fooling around, their\r\nunderlying reproductive strategy is a wide dissemination of genes to numerous\r\noffspring in the statistical hope that a few will make it. The proposed\r\ninitiative equals an attempt to \"buy people out\" of their biological destiny.\r\nSome may reject it ; some others may, in effect, make a successful transition\r\nto a higher-class reproductive strategy and become \"like us.\" Still others may\r\nbe \"neutered,\" with their vital energies being redirected in potentially\r\ndangerous directions.\r\n\r\n            Having\r\nsaid this, and given that there presumably are no panaceas, it might be\r\nappropriate to proceed with caution and let different proposals compete in the\r\nmarket of real life.\r\n\r\n            --Paul\r\nKailor\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Us and\r\nThem, Rights and Wrongs\r\n            \r\n\r\n            I was disappointed that Slate\r\nchose to publish \"The Norplant Option,\" by Stuart Taylor Jr. Why are we so\r\ninterested in interfering with the sexual and reproductive rights of Them,\r\nthose other than Us? If we turn the tables, and ask ourselves what laws we\r\nwould choose to enact to curtail our sexual and reproductive rights, it becomes\r\nimmediately clear how offensive and obtrusive such laws are to the rights of\r\nThem. What law would I be willing to sign against myself to curtail my sexual\r\nand reproductive freedoms? If I were certified insane, I might want the\r\ngovernment to assign a guardian who would act to protect my reproductive\r\nrights, as I would not have the mental faculties do so myself. Otherwise, I\r\ncannot imagine any situation in which I would choose to have some\r\nself-righteous neighbor, a k a our government, sticking his nose into my\r\nbusiness by telling me if, when, and how I can have sex or reproduce.\r\n\r\n            The fact\r\nthat these sexual and reproductive intrusions are typically proposed by white\r\nmen for black women should raise a red flag for anyone listening to such\r\nnonsense. One moment these self-righteous men would force a woman to bear a\r\nchild. The next moment these same self-righteous men would force a woman not to\r\nbear a child. Either way, I cannot think of a more intrusive act--short of\r\nhanging.\r\n\r\n            --Jim\r\nAdcock\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Duh\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Michael\r\nKinsley, you really are brain-dead to propose eliminating the 13 th\r\nAmendment to solve the welfare problem (\"Good Jobs at\r\nNow Wages\"). You should consider this truism: \"For every complex problem\r\nthere is a simple solution, and it is always wrong.\"\r\n\r\n            --John\r\nJames\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Two\r\nCheers for Slavery\r\n            \r\n\r\n            I was disappointed that\r\nMichael Kinsley's \"modest proposal\" to reform the welfare system by\r\nre-establishing slavery (\"Good Jobs at\r\nNow Wages\") did not mention the book from which it was likely inspired,\r\nHilaire Belloc's The Servile State (1911).\r\n\r\n            \r\nUnfortunately, a reader might consider the article merely humorous, describing\r\nan impossible proposition, where in fact, the basics of The Servile\r\nState (concentrated ownership and status-based laws governing\r\nemployee-employer relations) have been long established, and the need for\r\nslavery in the light of the increasingly degraded condition of the welfare\r\nclass becomes more evident. Slavery has been part of organized human society\r\nfor thousands of years; people should not assume that it has breathed its last.\r\nDespite its obvious drawbacks, I doubt it is the worst way to organize society,\r\nand it may be better than our present narcissistic fashion.\r\n\r\n            --Brian\r\nSponsler\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Apples\r\nand Oranges\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Please\r\ninform Robert Wright that he is indeed confused (\"Styles of\r\nPolygamy\"). There is a difference between adultery and divorce. I was\r\nflabbergasted that he could compare the morality of President Clinton and Bob\r\nDole and imply they are the same. Divorce is caused by many things, including\r\nadultery, but to imply there is no difference between the two is just\r\nunbelievable.\r\n\r\n            --Joel\r\nKimzey\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Blue\r\nNotes\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Jeffrey Steingarten's article\r\non food aversions (\"The\r\nOmnivore\") reminds me of a perplexing phenomenon I have observed during the\r\npast few years. I am talking about the apparent growth in the popularity of\r\nblue food.\r\n\r\n            A study conducted at Oregon\r\nState University (where the maraschino cherry was invented) about 25 years ago\r\nfound that blue was almost universally disliked as a food color.\r\n\r\n            Recently, however, something\r\nseems to have changed. I have seen many blue foods on the market: blue Jell-O,\r\nblue juicelike drinks, blue ice cream, and blue candy.\r\n\r\n            Mr.\r\nSteingarten, are we seeing a trend here? Assuming the Oregon State study was\r\ncorrect, what has changed in the Zeitgeist of the eating public to cause\r\nblue food to become acceptable? Do you think its rise in popularity parallels\r\nthat of blue lipstick and blue nail polish? Are we talking about postmodern\r\nfood here? Or punk food?\r\n\r\n            --James\r\nCurry\r\n\r\n            \r\n               To the\r\nLeft ...\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Still\r\nheavy on the left-wing status quo. Not even any token \"balance.\" Kind of like a\r\nClinton promise. Nothing really new or different here either. You can get the\r\nsame info in any of the mainstream press. Thoughtful and insightful?
