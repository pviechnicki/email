In a variety of cell types,\r\n        MTX initiates a cell death cascade that involves a sequence\r\n        of cellular events essentially identical to those activated\r\n        by stimulation of purinergic receptors of the P2Z/P2X \r\n        7 type. Initially, MTX causes a graded\r\n        increase in cytosolic free Ca 2+concentration ([Ca 2+] \r\n        i ). This is followed closely in time by\r\n        the opening of cytolytic/oncotic pores (COP) that allow the\r\n        exchange of large organic molecules of molecular weight\r\n        less than ~800 Daltons across the plasma membrane. COP\r\n        activation can be monitored by the cellular accumulation of\r\n        ethidium or propidium-based vital dyes, which are normally\r\n        excluded from the cytoplasm, but gain access to cellular\r\n        nucleotides via COP and exhibit an increase in\r\n        fluorescence. In isolated bovine aortic endothelial cells\r\n        (BAECs), the opening or activation of COP is associated\r\n        with formation of spherical membrane blebs with a diameter\r\n        of 3-5 microns [ 3 ] . The final stage of MTX-induced cell\r\n        death is cell lysis as indicated by the release of large\r\n        cytoplasmic enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).\r\n        Using time-lapse videomicroscopy, we have shown that\r\n        MTX-induced release of LDH from vascular endothelial cells\r\n        is associated with massive bleb dilation and rapid staining\r\n        of the nucleus with vital dyes [ 3 ] .\r\n        The initial MTX-induced increase in [Ca 2+] \r\n        i reflects the activation of a Ca\r\n        2+-permeable non-selective cation channel (CaNSC) [ 1 4 5 6\r\n        7 8 ] . This channel, which has a reported conductance in\r\n        the range of 12-40 pS depending on ionic conditions [ 5 9\r\n        10 11 ] , causes rapid membrane depolarization, which in\r\n        excitable cells, leads to activation of voltage-sensitive\r\n        channels. Although it appears that a rise in [Ca 2+] \r\n        i is necessary, but not sufficient for\r\n        activation of COP [ 1 ] , the molecular mechanisms by which\r\n        this occurs remains unknown. Likewise, the subsequent steps\r\n        leading to membrane blebbing and cytolysis are poorly\r\n        understood. It is however, well established that MTX causes\r\n        the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides in some cell types,\r\n        presumably via activation of phospholipase C (PLC) [ 12 13\r\n        ] . Activation of PLC by MTX appears to be indirect\r\n        resulting as a consequence of increased [Ca 2+] \r\n        i . These results suggest that PLC may\r\n        be involved in activation of COP and/or in the cytolysis\r\n        phase of MTX action. Thus, the initial purpose of the\r\n        present study was to determine the role of PLC in\r\n        MTX-induced cell death. To accomplish this goal, the effect\r\n        of U73122, a specific inhibitor of mammalian PLC was\r\n        examined. This compound selectively inhibits mammalian PLC,\r\n        but has no direct effect on bacterial PLC, bacterial or\r\n        mammalian phospholipase A \r\n        2 or adenylyl cyclase [ 14 ] . U73343, a\r\n        structural analogue of U73122 that differs by only one\r\n        double bond, has no direct effect on PLC and is commonly\r\n        used as a negative control. However, both compounds have\r\n        been shown to produce non-specific effects presumably\r\n        unrelated to inhibition of PLC [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 ] . The\r\n        results of the present study show, that both U73122 and\r\n        U73343 inhibit MTX-induced change in [Ca 2+] \r\n        i , ethidium uptake, and LDH release in\r\n        BAECs. Although these results suggest that blockade of\r\n        MTX-induced responses by the U-compounds is independent of\r\n        PLC, they identify these compounds as novel, potent, and\r\n        rapid blockers of MTX action. Interestingly, in experiments\r\n        designed to examine MTX reversibility, we discovered a\r\n        rather stunning change in the pattern of membrane blebbing.\r\n        Specifically, cells rescued from MTX by subsequent\r\n        application of U73343 exhibit a blebbing pattern known as\r\n        \"zeiosis\". Zeiosis, which comes from the Greek word \r\n        Z??? meaning \"to boil over\" [ 21 ] ,\r\n        is characterized by violent cytokinesis with continuous\r\n        bleb extension and retraction. Zeiosis has been associated\r\n        in many cell types with apoptosis [ 22 23 24 ] . The\r\n        results of the present experiments suggest that following a\r\n        brief exposure to MTX, U73343 rescues cells from oncotic\r\n        cell death. Cells that survive the initial insult may\r\n        ultimately die by apoptosis.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Results\r\n        \r\n          U73122 and U73343 inhibit MTX-induced change in [Ca\r\n          2+] iand ethidium uptake in BAECs.\r\n          To test the hypothesis that MTX-induced cell death\r\n          requires PLC, the effect of U73122, a specific inhibitor\r\n          of PLC was examined. Addition of MTX to fura-2 -loaded\r\n          BAECs, suspended in a cuvette in normal Ca 2+-containing\r\n          buffer at 37?C, produced a time-dependent increase in [Ca\r\n          2+] \r\n          i (Fig 1, \r\n          upper panel ). Addition of either\r\n          U73122 or U73343, the inactive analog, ~3 min before MTX\r\n          produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the\r\n          change in [Ca 2+] \r\n          i . U73343 exhibited a 3-fold greater\r\n          potency compared to U73122 (Fig 1, \r\n          insets ). Since U73343 has no\r\n          significant effect on PLC over the concentration range\r\n          employed [ 14 25 26 27 ] , these results suggest that\r\n          inhibition of the MTX-induced response is independent of\r\n          PLC.\r\n          Studies in BAECs have shown that following elevation\r\n          of [Ca 2+] \r\n          i , MTX causes the activation of large\r\n          pores (i.e., COP) that allow the flux of ethidium and\r\n          propidium-based vital dyes into the cell. As previously\r\n          reported [ 3 ] , MTX-induced uptake of ethidium in BAECs\r\n          was biphasic in the absence of the U-compounds (Fig 1, \r\n          lower panel ). The first phase,\r\n          which extends for ~5 min after addition of MTX, reflects\r\n          the activation of COP, whereas the second phase is\r\n          temporally associated with LDH release and thus reflects\r\n          cell lysis [ 3 ] . Addition of either U73122 or U73343,\r\n          ~3 min before MTX, produced an inhibition of ethidium\r\n          uptake (Fig 1, \r\n          lower panel ). Both phases of\r\n          ethidium uptake were attenuated by the U-compounds and\r\n          U73343 again appeared to have a greater potency compared\r\n          to U73122. These results suggest that inhibition of\r\n          MTX-induced change in [Ca 2+] \r\n          i prevents or attenuates both the\r\n          activation of COP and cytolysis.\r\n          To determine if the effects of the U-compounds are\r\n          reversible, BAECs were pre-treated with U73343 (5 ?M) for\r\n          5 min, washed and resuspended in normal extracellular\r\n          buffer in the absence of U73343. As seen in Fig 2, BAECs\r\n          pre-treated with U73343 partially recover responsiveness\r\n          to MTX following washout of U73343, but the response\r\n          failed to recover further over the subsequent 10 min.\r\n          Thus, the ability of U73343 to block the effect of MTX\r\n          appears to reflect both a rapidly reversible and slowly\r\n          reversible component.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          U73343 partially reverses the effect of MTX.\r\n          To determine if U73343 could reverse the action to\r\n          MTX, the compound was added to the cuvette after MTX. As\r\n          seen in Fig 3( \r\n          upper panel ), addition of U73343\r\n          at various times after MTX, immediately stopped further\r\n          increases in [Ca 2+] \r\n          i and resulted in an immediate\r\n          recovery of [Ca 2+] \r\n          i back towards basal resting levels.\r\n          Over the time-course examined however, [Ca 2+] \r\n          i never fully returned to the level\r\n          observed before MTX addition. The same experimental\r\n          protocol was employed for evaluation of ethidium uptake\r\n          (Fig 3, \r\n          lower panel ). Again, MTX-induced\r\n          uptake of ethidium was biphasic in the absence of U73343\r\n          ( \r\n          trace a ). Addition of the\r\n          U-compound shortly after MTX (i.e., at 200 sec; \r\n          trace e ), blocked both phases of\r\n          the response. Addition of U73343 towards the end of the\r\n          first phase (i.e., at either 400 or 500 sec; \r\n          traces b and c) had only a small\r\n          effect on the magnitude and time course of subsequent\r\n          ethidium uptake. However, when U73343 was added during\r\n          the first phase of ethidium uptake (i.e., 300 sec; \r\n          trace d ), dye accumulation in the\r\n          cells was immediately blocked. After a short delay, dye\r\n          uptake again increased with time to a value that was\r\n          substantially less than maximum. These results suggest\r\n          that U73343 is able to rapidly block both the MTX-induced\r\n          change in [Ca 2+] \r\n          i and COP formation when added shortly\r\n          after MTX. When U73343 is added at longer times, a large\r\n          proportion of the cells challenged by MTX have apparently\r\n          passed a point-of-no-return and are destined to die by\r\n          oncosis. However, the percentage of cells that either die\r\n          or survive depends on the time of U73343 addition after\r\n          MTX.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          U73343 rescues cells from MTX-induced oncotic cell\r\n          death.\r\n          To directly determine the effect of U73343 on\r\n          MTX-induced cell lysis, LDH release was correlated with\r\n          the change in [Ca 2+] \r\n          i and ethidium uptake in paired\r\n          experiments. As previously reported [ 3 ] and as seen in\r\n          Fig. 4( \r\n          bottom panel, black circles ),\r\n          MTX-induced LDH release in the absence of U73343,\r\n          correlates in time with the second phase of ethidium\r\n          uptake, demonstrating that the second phase reflects cell\r\n          lysis. Addition of U73343 during the first phase of the\r\n          MTX-induced response, immediately reversed the rise in\r\n          [Ca 2+] \r\n          i and blocked dye uptake. However, at\r\n          ~400 sec, ethidium uptake resumed and increased to an\r\n          intermediate value as was seen in Fig 3. This secondary\r\n          uptake of ethidium correlated in time with a partial LDH\r\n          release (Fig 4, \r\n          bottom panel, red triangles ).\r\n          U73343 alone had no effect on LDH release (Fig 4, \r\n          bottom panel, green squares ).\r\n          These results directly demonstrate that a percentage of\r\n          cells within the population died by oncosis, but perhaps\r\n          more importantly, that a significant number of the cells\r\n          are rescued from MTX-induced oncotic cell death when\r\n          U73343 is added within a short time-window after MTX.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          U73343 alters MTX-induced bleb formation.\r\n          Our previous studies showed that MTX causes a specific\r\n          change in cell morphology. In particular, MTX causes\r\n          dramatic time-dependent membrane blebbing in BAECs [ 3 ]\r\n          . An example is shown in Fig. 5. BAECs, attached to glass\r\n          coverslips and superfused with a solution containing\r\n          ethidium bromide, were simultaneously monitored by phase\r\n          and fluorescence microscopy. Selected images pairs\r\n          (merged phase/fluorescence images) are shown in Fig 5. At\r\n          time 5 min, the cells were superfused with a solution\r\n          containing MTX. No change in cell morphology was noted at\r\n          10 min, but by 25 min (i.e., 20 min after addition of\r\n          MTX) large membrane blebs were observed on essentially\r\n          all the cells within the field of view (Fig 5A, see\r\n          examples indicated by \r\n          blue arrows ). Additionally, clear\r\n          staining of the nucleus and cytoplasm by ethidium was\r\n          observed at this time. The graph shown in Fig\r\n          5Aquantifies the fluorescence change in individual cells\r\n          as a function of time. Note that uptake of ethidium in\r\n          response to MTX is biphasic at the single cell level and\r\n          that heterogeneity between cells primarily reflects the\r\n          time of entry into the second phase of dye uptake, i.e.,\r\n          the cell lysis phase. The dynamic nature of the\r\n          MTX-induced bleb formation, bleb dilation, and ethidium\r\n          uptake can be observed by viewing the time-lapse movie\r\n          associated with this experiment (see Additional File 1).\r\n          As previously reported, blebs form during the first phase\r\n          of dye uptake, whereas rather dramatic bleb dilation is\r\n          seen during the cytolysis phase of rapid dye uptake. In\r\n          the continuous presence of MTX, blebs continue to swell\r\n          and in many cases seem to disappear as they dilate and\r\n          extend out of the focal plane.\r\n          Addition of U73343 (10 ?M) 2-3 min before MTX (0.3 nM)\r\n          completely blocks ethidium uptake and the associated\r\n          change in cell morphology. As seen in Fig 5B, essentially\r\n          no blebs are observed at 25 min (i.e., 20 min after MTX)\r\n          and little or no dye uptake is seen out to 40 min. Thus,\r\n          the major morphological changes associated with MTX\r\n          challenge are blocked by U73343. However, by time 40 min,\r\n          some of the cells (11 out of 53) detach from the glass\r\n          coverslip and round-up (Fig 5B, see examples indicated by\r\n          \r\n          blue arrows ). The time-lapse movie\r\n          of this experiment revealed that these detached cells\r\n          were actually undergoing a novel type of membrane\r\n          blebbing called zeiosis (see Additional File 2). As can\r\n          be seen from the movie ( Additional File 2), zeiosis is\r\n          characterized by cytokinesis with time-dependent bleb\r\n          extension and retraction. Note that during zeiosis, no\r\n          ethidium uptake is observed, i.e., there is little or no\r\n          change in cell fluorescence. This result suggests that\r\n          COP is not activated and the cells do not undergo a gross\r\n          change in plasmalemmal permeability during zeiosis. At 1\r\n          nM MTX, the number of BAECs that undergo zeiosis in the\r\n          presence of U73343 is increased (see Additional File 3).\r\n          As seen in this movie ( Additional File 3), the majority\r\n          of the cells in the field of view (16 out of 24) undergo\r\n          zeiosis, yet there is no ethidium uptake over the time\r\n          frame examined, despite the higher concentration of MTX\r\n          employed. Little or no zeiosis was observed in the\r\n          absence of MTX, i.e., in the presence of either U73343\r\n          alone (4 zeotic cells out of 113) or vehicle alone (DMSO;\r\n          5 zeotic cells out of 146) examined for 40 min. Thus, the\r\n          ability of MTX to cause zeiosis is specific, but requires\r\n          the presence of U73343, presumably to block or prevent\r\n          rapid oncotic cell death.\r\n          The cuvette experiments suggest that BAECs challenged\r\n          with MTX can be rescued from oncotic cell death if U73343\r\n          is added to the bath solution within a narrow time frame\r\n          after the addition of MTX. To further test this\r\n          hypothesis, paired experiments were performed at the\r\n          single cell level. BAECs, attached to coverslips were\r\n          first challenged with MTX and subsequently rescued by\r\n          addition of U73343. The percentage of a) dead cells\r\n          (indicated by nuclear staining with ethidium), b) cells\r\n          undergoing zeiosis, and c) surviving cells (indicated by\r\n          the lack of membrane blebbing and lack of nuclear\r\n          staining with ethidium) was quantified at time 40 min\r\n          (Fig 6). All of the cells treated with vehicle alone\r\n          (DMSO) before MTX exhibited the typical blebbing profile\r\n          and nuclear staining indicative of rapid oncotic cell\r\n          death. BAECs treated with U73343 before MTX were\r\n          essentially protected from cell death, but ~35% of the\r\n          total population exhibited zeiosis. The same pattern was\r\n          observed when U73343 was added 4 min after MTX, i.e.,\r\n          full protection from oncosis with ~40% zeiosis. However,\r\n          ~15% of the cells died by oncosis when U73343 was added\r\n          at 6 min after MTX (see Additional File 4) and this\r\n          percentage increased to >90% when U73343 was added at\r\n          7 min after MTX (see Additional File 5). Addition of\r\n          U73343 10 min after MTX was the same as vehicle control,\r\n          i.e., all the cells lyse by time 40 min. These results\r\n          are consistent with the cuvette studies and directly\r\n          demonstrate that within a narrow time window after MTX\r\n          challenge, U73343 can rescue BAECs from oncotic cell\r\n          death.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          BAECs rescued from oncosis by U73343 die by\r\n          apoptosis.\r\n          Zeiosis is a type of membrane blebbing associated with\r\n          apoptosis [ 22 23 24 ] . Since U73343 protects cells from\r\n          MTX-induced oncosis and causes zeiosis, we considered the\r\n          possibility that the cells surviving the initial insult\r\n          may ultimately die by apoptosis. To test this hypothesis,\r\n          BAECs were treated with vehicle alone (DMSO), U73343\r\n          alone, or MTX followed by U73343, and specific caspase-3\r\n          activity was determined after 48 hrs by the fluorescence\r\n          substrate assay (Fig 7). A significant increase in\r\n          caspase-3 activity (p < 0.035; n = 3) was observed in\r\n          cells challenged with MTX and subsequently rescued by\r\n          U73343, consistent with increased apoptotic cell\r\n          death.\r\n          Additional file 1\r\n          \r\n          MTX-induced EB uptake and membrane\r\n          blebbing in single BAECs.

First, U73122 and U73343, compounds that are\r\n        commonly used to examine PLC-dependent mechanisms, potently\r\n        inhibit MTX-induced change in [Ca 2+] \r\n        i , vital dye uptake, and oncotic cell\r\n        death in BAECs. The fact that U73343, which has essentially\r\n        no effect on PLC at the concentrations employed [ 14 25 26\r\n        27 ] , is more potent than U73122 on MTX-induced responses,\r\n        clearly shows that the effect of these agents is unrelated\r\n        to inhibition of PLC. Since U73343 can rapidly block and\r\n        reverse the increase in [Ca 2+] \r\n        i induced by MTX, it seems likely that\r\n        these compounds directly block the MTX-activated channels\r\n        in BAECs, perhaps acting as pore blockers. However, since\r\n        the effect of U73343 appears to be slowly reversible, there\r\n        may be additional sites/mechanisms of blocking action for\r\n        these agents. Another class of compounds known as\r\n        imidazoles, of which SKF 96365 is the best studied, have\r\n        also been shown to block MTX-induced responses in many cell\r\n        types [ 5 7 12 28 ] . The imidazoles, which are antifungal\r\n        agents that inhibit cytochrome P \r\n        450 , are relatively non-selective and\r\n        are known to block voltage-gated Ca 2+channels and\r\n        receptor-activated Ca 2+influx through so-called\r\n        store-operated channels (SOCs) [ 29 ] , but their mechanism\r\n        of action in this regard remains unknown.\r\n        U73343 appears to be relatively more selective than SKF\r\n        96365 with respect to Ca 2+influx pathways. Most studies\r\n        find that U73343 has no effect on receptor-mediated\r\n        increase in [Ca 2+] \r\n        i . However, Berven and Barritt [ 15 ]\r\n        report that U73343 partially blocked vasopressin-induced Ca\r\n        2+influx, but did not inhibit release of Ca 2+from\r\n        intracellular stores in hepatocytes. And Wang [ 16 ]\r\n        reported that U73343 suppressed elevation of [Ca 2+] \r\n        i in neutrophils challenged with FMLP in\r\n        the presence, but not the absence, of extracellular Ca\r\n        2+Both reports are consistent with a lack of effect of\r\n        U73343 on receptor-mediated activation of PLC and a direct\r\n        inhibitory effect on Ca 2+influx pathways in these cells.\r\n        The results of the present study therefore, suggest that\r\n        the MTX-sensitive channel may be responsible for the rise\r\n        in [Ca 2+] \r\n        i produced by receptor stimulation in\r\n        some cell types, but not in others. In this regard, Worley\r\n        et al. [ 8 ] showed that SOCs in pancreatic ?-cells have\r\n        characteristics essentially identical to channels activated\r\n        by MTX in the same cell type. Thus, U73343 may be useful\r\n        for the ultimate identification and characterization of the\r\n        physiological role of MTX-sensitive channels. Lastly,\r\n        because MTX is one of the toxins associated with ciguatera\r\n        seafood poisoning, the identification of U73343 as a potent\r\n        and relatively specific blocker of MTX-induced cell death\r\n        cascade may ultimately lead to improved therapeutic\r\n        interventions.\r\n        The second major conclusion supported by the results of\r\n        the present study is that MTX apparently has an effect on\r\n        BAECs that is independent of the rise in [Ca 2+] \r\n        i . We previously showed that MTX causes\r\n        the appearance of membrane blebs on the surface of the\r\n        endothelial cells [ 3 ] . Initially these blebs are of\r\n        small diameter (3-5 microns) and bleb formation correlates\r\n        with the first phase of vital dye uptake. However, during\r\n        MTX-induced cytolysis, as indicated by the release of LDH,\r\n        the membrane blebs actually exhibit a dramatic increase in\r\n        diameter. This bleb dilation phase is clearly associated\r\n        with rapid, intense staining of the nucleus with vital\r\n        dyes. It is well established that the acute effects of MTX\r\n        on [Ca 2+] \r\n        i , uptake of vital dyes, and membrane\r\n        blebbing require extracellular Ca 2+ [ 1 3 ] , but the role\r\n        of cytosolic Ca 2+remains unknown. Preliminary studies in\r\n        fibroblasts suggest that vital dye uptake via COP is\r\n        attenuated in cells loaded with the Ca 2+chelator BAPTA [ 1\r\n        ] , but the effect of BAPTA loading on MTX-induced bleb\r\n        formation has not been examined. The results of the present\r\n        study show that despite a blockade of MTX-induced change in\r\n        [Ca 2+] \r\n        i , addition of U73343 either before, or\r\n        within a short time after MTX, produced a blebbing profile\r\n        known as zeiosis. The term zeiosis was first used by\r\n        Costero and Pomerat [ 21 ] 50 years ago to describe the\r\n        appearance of membrane vesicles on the surface of nerve\r\n        cells in culture, as visualized using time-lapse\r\n        cinematography. Although the cellular mechanisms remain\r\n        poorly defined, it is now clear that zeiosis is associated\r\n        with apoptotic cell death (for review [ 24 30 ] ). In\r\n        static images, the morphological changes associated with\r\n        apoptosis appear as membrane blebs covering the surface of\r\n        the cells [ 31 32 33 ] . However, time-lapse images reveal\r\n        that blebs protrude and retract in a dynamic fashion, a\r\n        hallmark of zeiosis [ 22 23 ] . Dynamic membrane blebbing\r\n        appears to involve a dramatic change in the cytoskeleton\r\n        and may be induced by a caspase-3-mediated cleavage of\r\n        ROCK-I, a Rho-activated serine/threonine kinase known to\r\n        stimulate actinomycin-based contractions [ 31 32 33 ] . A\r\n        similar profile can be seen in the videos of MTX-induced\r\n        cell death in the presence of U73343 ( \r\n        Files 2 and 3 ). The cells first lose\r\n        adhesion to the coverslip, retract and roundup. This is\r\n        followed by zeiotic membrane blebbing. Vital dyes are\r\n        excluded during this time suggesting that COP is not\r\n        activated and that there is no gross loss of membrane\r\n        integrity during blebbing. It is important to note that\r\n        these MTX-induced events are only observed in the presence\r\n        of U73343 and occur in the absence of a measurable rise in\r\n        [Ca 2+] \r\n        i . To our knowledge, this is the first\r\n        evidence that MTX has effects independent of a rise in [Ca\r\n        2+] \r\n        i . Perhaps more importantly, the\r\n        results of the present study suggest that U73343 converts\r\n        MTX-induced oncosis into apoptosis and that a rise in [Ca\r\n        2+] \r\n        i is necessary for oncotic cell\r\n        death.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Conclusions\r\n        In conclusion, U73343 blocks the MTX-induced cell death\r\n        cascade in BAECs and converts the normal blebbing profile\r\n        seen with this toxin into zeiosis, a form of dynamic\r\n        membrane blebbing commonly associated with apoptosis and\r\n        characterized by bleb extension and retraction. U73343 may\r\n        prove useful for identification and characterization of\r\n        MTX-activated cation channels and for understanding their\r\n        physiological role in cell signaling and cell death.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Materials and Methods\r\n        \r\n          Solutions and reagents.\r\n          Unless otherwise indicated, HEPES-buffered saline\r\n          (HBS) contained 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl \r\n          2 , 10 mM D-glucose, 1.8 mM CaCl \r\n          2 , 15 mM HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum\r\n          albumin, pH adjusted to 7.40 at 37?C with NaOH.

All cultures\r\n          demonstrated contact-inhibited cobblestone appearance\r\n          typical of endothelial cells grown to confluence.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Measurement of the apparent cytosolic free Ca\r\n          2+concentration.\r\n          [Ca 2+] \r\n          i was measured using the fluorescent\r\n          indicator, fura-2, as previously described [ 35 ] .\r\n          Experiments were performed with cells in the twelfth to\r\n          twentieth passage and 2-3 days post-confluency. Briefly,\r\n          cells were harvested and re-suspended in HBS containing\r\n          20 ?M fura-2/AM. Following 30 min incubation at 37?C, the\r\n          cell suspension was diluted ~10-fold with HBS, incubated\r\n          for an additional 30 min, washed and resuspended in fresh\r\n          HBS. Aliquots from this final suspension were subjected\r\n          to centrifugation and washed twice immediately prior to\r\n          fluorescence measurement. Fluorescence was recorded using\r\n          an SLM 8100 spectrophotofluorometer; excitation\r\n          wavelength alternated between 340 and 380 nm and\r\n          fluorescence intensity was monitored at an emission\r\n          wavelength of 510 nm. All measurements were performed at\r\n          37?C.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Measurement of vital dye uptake.\r\n          Vital dye uptake was determined as previously\r\n          described [ 1 2 3 ] . Briefly, an aliquot (2 ml) of\r\n          dispersed cells suspended in HBS at 37?C was placed in a\r\n          cuvette. Following addition of ethidium bromide (final\r\n          concentrations of 5 ?M), fluorescence was recorded as a\r\n          function of time with excitation and emission wavelengths\r\n          of 302/560 nm, respectively. All ethidium bromide\r\n          fluorescence values were corrected for background\r\n          (extracellular) dye fluorescence and expressed as a\r\n          percentage relative to the value obtained following\r\n          complete permeabilization of the cells with 50 ?M\r\n          digitonin.\r\n          For single cell measurement of vital dye uptake, BAECs\r\n          in complete-DMEM were sparsely seeded on circular glass\r\n          coverslips and used within 2-3 days of seeding. The\r\n          coverslips were mounted in temperature-controlled\r\n          perfusion chambers and placed on the stage of Nikon\r\n          Diaphot inverted microscope. The cells were illuminated\r\n          with light from a 75 watt xenon lamp using a 0-5722\r\n          filter cube obtained from Molecular Probes.\r\n          Epifluorescence was recorded using a SPOT? camera\r\n          (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) and images\r\n          were acquired and analyzed using SimplePCI imaging\r\n          software (Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). During\r\n          each experiment, phase and fluorescence image pairs were\r\n          collected at 30 second intervals with shutter controllers\r\n          switching between light and fluorescent illumination. The\r\n          fluorescence images were used to quantify dye uptake. A\r\n          region over the nucleus of individual cells was defined\r\n          and the average fluorescence intensity of the region was\r\n          quantified as a function of time. Phase images were\r\n          contrast enhanced, digitally merged with the\r\n          corresponding fluorescent images, and time-lapse videos\r\n          were created using the SimplePCI software.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)\r\n          release.\r\n          Aliquots of dispersed cells (2 ml) were incubated at\r\n          37?C for various lengths of time in the presence and\r\n          absence of MTX. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation\r\n          for 15 sec at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge\r\n          (model 5415 C). The supernatants were removed, and placed\r\n          on ice. Enzyme activity in aliquots (50 ?l) of the\r\n          supernatants was determined using the LD-L kit from\r\n          Sigma. All values are expressed as percent LDH released\r\n          relative to the value obtained following permeabilization\r\n          of the cells with 50 ?M digitonin.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Measurement of specific caspase-3 activity.\r\n          Extracts were obtained from confluent BAECs following\r\n          the indicated treatment using a freeze-thaw lysis\r\n          protocol. BAECs were mechanically harvested, washed, and\r\n          resuspended in 500 ?l lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5,\r\n          100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100). The cell\r\n          suspension was frozen using liquid nitrogen and rapidly\r\n          thawed in a 37?C water bath. Following 5 freeze-thaw\r\n          cycles, the cell suspensions were subjected to\r\n          centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 rpm at 4?C in an\r\n          Eppendorf 5417R centrifuge. Supernatants were collected\r\n          and stored at -20?C. Protein concentration was determined\r\n          by the method of Lowry using bovine serum albumin as\r\n          standard. Cytosolic extracts (300 ?g protein) were\r\n          assayed for caspase-3 activity according to the protocol\r\n          described in the EnzChek Caspase-3 Assay Kit (Molecular\r\n          Probes). Specific caspase-3 activity, defined as the\r\n          activity inhibitable by Ac-DEVD-CHO, was normalized to\r\n          that of untreated BAECs.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n
