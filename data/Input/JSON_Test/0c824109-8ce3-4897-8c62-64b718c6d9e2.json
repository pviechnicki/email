It's easy enough to go\r\nalong with, too, especially with Anjelica Huston's voice purring in your ear\r\n(audiotapes have replaced wall panels for this show) about how L?ger was\r\npeerless in portraying the feel of the modern city.\r\n\r\n            A hulk of\r\na man with a capacious appetite for women and red wine, L?ger seemed the right\r\nchoice to muscle French painting out of the cafe and the artist's studio and\r\ninto the world of steel girders and factory smoke. He took elements from the\r\nmajor 20 th -century schools of art--Cubism, but also Futurism,\r\nNeoclassicism, and Surrealism--and forged his own peculiar idiom, one that\r\nseemed as racy and street-smart as slang. Of the modern masters, he came\r\nclosest to capturing the dynamism and rhythm of our headlong century.\r\n\r\n            But beyond his up-to-the-minute virtuosity, L?ger doesn't\r\nplay his designated role of machine-age hero all that convincingly. Born on a\r\nNormandy farm, the only child of a cattle breeder, L?ger never lost a palpable\r\nnostalgia for the countryside, reminders of which appear in some of his most\r\nurban paintings--such as the incongruous tree branches on the elevated platform\r\nin Construction Workers of 1950. By 1900 he had made his way to Paris,\r\nwhere he first trained as an architect, then studied at a couple of traditional\r\nart academies. He fell in with the Cubists, whose reverence for C?zanne's\r\nFormalist innovations--depicting landscape and figures with interlocking\r\nplanes--he shared. Later, L?ger would claim he freed himself from C?zanne by\r\nmeans of abstraction; the path-breaking paintings he called \"Contrast of Forms\"\r\n(circa 1913)--fully abstract exercises in funnels, cylinders, and arcs--retain\r\nall their vigorous charm.\r\n\r\n            During\r\nWorld War I, L?ger served for a year in the worst regions of the Western Front.\r\nIt was a democratizing experience by his own account, making him feel, as he\r\nput it in an often quoted remark, \"on a level with the whole of the French\r\npeople.\" His extraordinary Card Game (1917) uses those \"contrasting forms\" to reconfigure a\r\ntraditional genre subject (C?zanne's Card Players is the most familiar\r\nexample). L?ger captures a leisurely break from the battlefield routine, but\r\nhis tin-can soldiers are still fully armored, and their cards suggest an\r\nequation between war and a game of chance. The earth-colored table is as riven\r\nand scarred as the trenches of the Argonne.\r\n\r\n            After the war came The City (1919), probably his\r\nsingle most famous painting. Some grimly monochromatic figures mount the\r\nstairway in the center of the picture--returning soldiers, perhaps?--but\r\notherwise the city seems a cheerful, colorful refuge, decked with tasteful\r\nadvertising posters. \"Never has the poetry of the first machine age been so\r\ngrandly and proudly exalted,\" comments the art historian John Golding in the\r\nexhibition catalog. Maybe so, but there's something opportunistic about L?ger's\r\nabrupt embrace of urban life. It's as though after wrestling long and hard with\r\nC?zanne's dictum that the artist should paint the world of nature in terms of\r\nspheres, cylinders, and cones, L?ger realized: Hey, here's an environment\r\nthat's actually made of these shapes!\r\n\r\n            The cogs\r\nand pistons that dominate his paintings of the early 1920s remain unusually\r\nintimate, human-scale. It's true that he's drawn to machinery, but his favorite\r\ndevices are typewriters and accordions and siphons--nonthreatening mechanisms\r\nthat lack the depersonalizing, menacing quality of, say, Fritz Lang's\r\nnightmarish film Metropolis . Although L?ger was a Communist, with\r\npronounced sympathy for the working man, his experience of factory conditions\r\napparently was limited to what he'd heard from his fellow card-playing\r\nsoldiers. (His Social Realist Construction Workers was displayed in the\r\ncanteen of the Renault auto factory, to predictably tepid response. It was the\r\nsame factory where the French philosopher Simone Weil worked long hours to\r\nexperience the true lot of the worker.)\r\n\r\n            The alienation of modern life--a central theme in the work\r\nof L?ger's literary friends Henry Miller and Blaise Cendrars--doesn't enter the\r\npainter's resolutely optimistic vision. Even New York City, where he waited out\r\nWorld War II, takes on cozy contours for L?ger, who was quickly hired by Nelson\r\nRockefeller to decorate his New York apartment (the fireplace surround is in\r\nthe MoMA show). L?ger saw the city of the 1940s through a 1920s temperament,\r\nreworking a drawing of 1924 into his appealing oil The Three Musicians\r\n(1944), a particular hit of the MoMA show. The looming skyscrapers of Georgia\r\nO'Keefe's between-the-wars paintings or Charles Sheeler's threatening\r\nsmokestacks have no counterpart in L?ger's work. His Good-bye New York\r\n(1946), the cover illustration for the exhibition catalog, has no urban feel at\r\nall, despite some free-floating girders and a row of neckties glimpsed at a\r\nTimes Square stall. The stray fences and tree limbs, from the upstate\r\ncountryside where L?ger spent his summers, are more prominent. Back in Paris,\r\nhe painted stilted idylls in the countryside, utopias no one would want to live\r\nin. The most sophisticated machinery here is the bicycle.\r\n\r\n            The story\r\nthat MoMA's show tells about L?ger--his heroic struggle with C?zanne, his\r\nescape into abstraction, his flirtation with competing schools of Modernism,\r\nhis late monumentality--is the same story that MoMA's permanent collection\r\ntells, with Picasso as the hero. But there's another way to think of L?ger's\r\ndevelopment. As the machinery shrank in his pictures, his women grew in\r\nprominence and size. So many Modernist breakthroughs involved the visual\r\ndismantling of a woman--Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) on the\r\nsecond floor of MoMA, de Kooning's Woman, I (1950-51) on the third--that\r\nit should come as no surprise that L?ger began the same way, with his\r\nsystematically fragmented Woman in Blue (1912), the first piece in the\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\n            Many of L?ger's key paintings seem to have been inspired by\r\nthe question of what women are, exactly. Are they companions in the human realm\r\nor visitors from the natural--or even the mechanical--world? Are they animal,\r\nvegetable, or mineral? The metallic moving parts of Woman in Blue yield\r\nto the Neoclassical contours of the marmoreal Three Women (1921), who\r\nare as still as the still-life lunch they'll never eat. has a primitive, Easter\r\nIsland look: L?ger paints a holly leaf in exactly the same black-on-red idiom,\r\nas though the nude woman is a botanical exhibit. A decade later, in his\r\nComposition With Two Parrots (1935-39), the women are still bulbous and\r\ninert, but there's blood in their veins. The painting suggests an equation\r\nbetween two forms of wildlife: the clothed boy holds a parrot, his companion\r\nholds a woman.\r\n\r\n            L?ger's ideas about women are\r\ninseparable from his ideas about machinery. His clever Ballet\r\nM?canique --an influential little non-narrative film he made in 1924 (MoMA\r\nhas it on a continuous reel)--intercuts dancing pistons and kitchenware with\r\nblinking eyes and a mouth that opens and closes rhythmically. The idea, L?ger\r\nclaimed, was to prove \"that machines and fragments of them, that ordinary\r\nmanufactured objects, have plastic possibilities.\" In other words, detached\r\nfrom their familiar uses and manipulated on film, such objects could be\r\nanimated, rendered flexible, and--in the sculptural sense--\"plastic.\"\r\nConversely, L?ger was also implying that human beings are composed of moving\r\nparts. But the blinking eyes in his mechanical ballet are heavy with mascara,\r\nwhile the sexy mouth shines with lipstick. In his dreams of the future, L?ger\r\nwanted his machines to be as sexy and intimate as beautiful women, and his\r\nwomen to be as available and predictable as household appliances.\r\n\r\n
