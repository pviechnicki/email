Studios ought to reap huge profits, but don't because they overpay\r\nstars and produce too many expensive films. (The average studio movie costs $60\r\nmillion to make and market.) The good news for Hollywood, according to the\r\nEconomist : Foreign movie producers are even less business-savvy. An\r\narticle on Zaire advises rebel leader Laurent Kabila not to compromise with\r\nPresident Mobutu Sese Seko, because any delay in toppling the government will\r\ndamage the country even more. (For a backgrounder on Zaire, see Slate's\r\n\"The Gist.\") A\r\npackage of stories on the British election blames John Major's troubles on his\r\npersonal weakness, not his policies. Also, a 24-page survey on management\r\nconsulting finds the industry vigorous, profitable, and a bit too\r\nsecretive.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                  New \r\n                  Republic , April 7\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nFriday, March 21)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The cover\r\npackage takes Congress to task, noting that congressional fund raising is as\r\nslimy as White House fund raising. Among the outrages cited: Legislators\r\nselling bills and lobbyists writing bills. Another article rips Congress for\r\nits sluggish implementation of the Congressional Accountability Act, the 1995\r\nlaw that was supposed to apply labor and civil-rights laws to Hill employees.\r\nAlso, the \"TRB\" column offers this campaign-finance scoop: Clinton will soon\r\nask the Federal Election Commission to pass regulations restricting \"soft\r\nmoney,\" accomplishing by executive action what Hill Republicans refuse to do\r\nlegislatively. And a piece says that, despite the establishment of the $5\r\nbillion gold fund, the Swiss aren't at all sorry for their atrocious behavior\r\nduring World War II.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               \r\n                  New\r\nYork Times Magazine , March 23\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nThursday, March 20)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The cover\r\nstory compares Nelson Mandela to George Washington. Mandela suppresses his\r\nemotions in favor of the common good, and this serene rationalism has allowed\r\nSouth Africa to escape violence and recrimination. \"Elders on Ice\" observes the\r\ntwilight careers of New York Rangers Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier: The\r\n\"greatest player ever\" and the \"most-driven player ever\" are past their prime,\r\nbut still know how to win. Also, the technology columnist dismisses Internet\r\n\"push\"--in which content is delivered to users rather than fetched\r\nby them--as a silly, doomed trend. (For Slate's take, see \"Push Me, Pull\r\nYou.\")\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                  Harper's , April 1997\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nThursday, March 20)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            An\r\nimmensely long article condemns the Drug Enforcement Administration's war on\r\npoppy growers. Though poppies have legitimate commercial use (poppy-seed\r\nbagels, for instance), the feds are paranoid that gardeners will harvest them\r\nfor opium. The author grows his own opium poppies, and wonders if he's going to\r\nbe prosecuted. Also, a creepy explanation for the Rwanda genocide: \"Judgment\r\nDay\" asserts that Rwandans are incredibly law-abiding, so when the government\r\nordered them to kill Tutsis, they obeyed without a second thought. The writer\r\nvisits Rwanda's awful prisons, where 92,000 people await trial.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                  Newsweek and Time , March 24\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nTuesday, March 18)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               Newsweek looks to the\r\nheavens. Time looks for heaven. Newsweek 's cover package, \"The\r\nGreat Comet,\" celebrates Hale-Bopp. A long article speculates about how ancient\r\nEgyptians, Chinese, and Sumerians greeted the comet on its last visit in 2213\r\nB.C. (It was undoubtedly an important omen--of what, no one knows.) A related\r\nstory tells the when-and-where of the comet's flyby.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Time 's cover asks,\r\n\"Does Heaven Exist?\" Until this century, Christianity was\r\nobsessed with describing heaven, but now \"heaven is AWOL.\" Most Christian\r\nclerics have stopped talking about it, because it's too controversial and too\r\nhard to reconcile with modern science.\r\n\r\n            Both\r\nmagazines cover the Biggie Smalls murder and assert that gangsta rap has gone\r\ntoo far. Also in Time : A profile of Zairian rebel leader Kabila predicts that he'll\r\ntopple Mobutu, but notes that he's only succeeding because Uganda and Rwanda\r\nare helping him. Newsweek presents the government's case against Timothy\r\nMcVeigh, concluding that \"it would have to be a very stubborn juror indeed to\r\nhold out in the face of the evidence.\"\r\n\r\n            \r\n               \r\n                  The\r\nNew Yorker , March 24\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nTuesday, March 18)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \"Unarmed\r\nWarriors\" describes the travails of the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross. The traditional rules of war don't apply in places like Rwanda and\r\nBosnia, where the Red Cross can't persuade soldiers to fight humanely. A\r\nharrowing trip with Red Cross workers in Afghanistan is described. A long\r\narticle, pegged to The Godfather 's 25 th anniversary, recounts\r\nits filming in intricate detail. Also, a writer proposes a grand unified theory\r\nof stardom: Celebrityhood always lasts three years (David Letterman,\r\n1992-95; Ronald Reagan, 1983-86; etc.).\r\n\r\n            \r\n               \r\n                  U.S.\r\nNews & World Report and Weekly Standard , March 24\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nTuesday, March 18)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Race makes the covers.\r\nU.S. News ' cover\r\npackage, hooked to the 50 th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's\r\nmajor-league debut, argues that sports are bad for black America. While only\r\none in 10,000 high-school athletes will ever play professionally, 66 percent of\r\nblack teen-age boys believe they could be pros, and the resulting overemphasis\r\non sports has diverted blacks from educational achievement. The Standard\r\ndeplores black and white obsession with \"white racism,\" arguing that it turns\r\nblacks into permanent victims. A related article savages the black newsmagazine\r\nEmerge for its paranoid, anti-white style. The magazine's popularity\r\namong black professionals is an alarming indication of how alienated the black\r\nmiddle class is from mainstream white America.\r\n\r\n            Also in\r\nU.S. News , a story asserts that the Polish army is too rigid and too\r\ntechnologically backward to integrate successfully into NATO.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                  Vanity Fair , April 1997\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nTuesday, March 18)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The\r\nannual Hollywood issue is endless (386 pages). An article about Ted Turner and\r\nJane Fonda's marriage asserts that Fonda always dissolves herself in her male\r\npartner, whether he's a radical like Tom Hayden or a plutocrat like Turner. A\r\nmovie critic blames the decline of movie criticism on Pauline Kael's disciples\r\n(among those implicated, Slate's David Edelstein). Also, much Hollywood\r\nhistory: articles on the feud between Hollywood gossips Louella Parsons and\r\nHedda Hopper, Roman Polanski's statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl, and the\r\nshady activities of the now deceased Hollywood fixer/mob lawyer Sidney Korshak.\r\nTen budding starlets adorn the cover.
