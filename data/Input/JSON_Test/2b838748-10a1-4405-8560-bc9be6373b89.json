But this message wasn't about funding technology: It was\r\nabout funding the next president of the United States.\r\n\r\n            \"Dear\r\nFriend,\" it began, \"Please send $1,000 and call five friends to join us in\r\nsupport of George W. Bush for president.\" The e-solicitation, dated Sept. 4,\r\ngave out Draper's office phone number at the firm of Draper Fisher Jurvetson,\r\nhis e-mail address, and a place for checks to be sent.\r\n\r\n            \r\nContributors who raised $5,000, the e-mail said, could \"be listed as a cohost\r\nand be invited to the VIP photo reception\" at an event in Redwood City, Calif.,\r\nSept. 30. The final line said: \"P.S. Forward this e-mail on to your address\r\nlist and get some viral marketing going.\"\r\n\r\n            Many\r\nrecipients did, but at least a few questioned whether this was an authorized\r\nrequest for money, or a hoax. \"Obviously, someone is out to get him,\" said Dave\r\nAlexander, executive vice president of VirtualFund.com, shortly after receiving\r\nthe e-mail. Alexander predicted that Draper would be flooded by angry\r\ncomplaints from people \"who don't know who he is and who think he really did\r\nspam them.\"\r\n\r\n            In\r\nfact, Draper did spam them. \"The e-mail was real,\" Draper later confirmed. \"I'm\r\nhappy about it because I happen to think George Bush is the best man for the\r\njob.\"\r\n\r\n            \r\nWelcome to the murky world of e-mail fund raising.\r\n\r\n            As\r\nmore Americans and more political campaigns get on the Internet, e-mail is\r\nreplacing many of the campaign tasks traditionally handled through telephone\r\nand direct mail. About $3 billion will be spent on all political direct mail in\r\nthe current four-year electoral cycle, according to Ron Faucheaux, editor in\r\nchief of Campaigns & Elections magazine. In many cases, direct mail\r\nrepresents a campaign's single largest expenditure (although presidential\r\ncampaigns have a different spending mix, because of their lopsided use of TV\r\nadvertising).\r\n\r\n            As a\r\nfund-raising device, e-mail has powerful advantages over direct mail. For\r\nstarters, it's essentially free. It's also self-replicating: One enthusiastic\r\nrecipient can easily send e-mail along to dozens of others, without the\r\ncampaign having to rent an additional donor list.\r\n\r\n            But as\r\nthe Draper incident shows, the process can also create some unexpected\r\nheadaches. A traditional direct mail solicitation usually contains legal\r\nreassurances that the solicitation is authorized (and the cost of postage makes\r\nan unauthorized mailing an expensive proposition), which some e-mail\r\nsolicitations currently lack. Also, most individuals do not screen their e-mail\r\naddress books politically, meaning that a solicitation sent out to all a\r\nperson's contacts may well end up in the hands of someone who doesn't want\r\nit--which could turn into a public relations problem.\r\n\r\n            That's\r\nwhat happened when Anthony Perkins, editor in chief of Red Herring\r\nmagazine, sent out an invitation to the same Bush luncheon as Draper. He used a\r\nlist from Red Eye, one of the e-mail newsletters that Red Herring\r\npublishes. Using a pun on Red Herring 's name, Perkins' note appeared to\r\nimply that a Bush donation would enhance readers' relationship to the\r\npublication. \"If you want to be a really big Fish, you can become a cohost of\r\nthis event by committing to raise $5,000, which will get you into a special VIP\r\nreception with the governor,\" the e-mail said.\r\n\r\n            The\r\nmessage confused some of Red Eye's subscribers, and Red Herring rapidly\r\nbegan a damage control campaign. (Perkins did not respond to several requests\r\nfor an interview.) First, the publication took the position that the e-mail\r\npitch mistakenly went out under the guise of a Red Eye editorial product, when\r\nin fact it was a paid political advertisement.\r\n\r\n            A few\r\ndays later, Perkins sent out a letter to Red Eye subscribers, apologizing for\r\nthe blurring of journalistic and political lines. \"As you know, I have strong\r\npolitical ties to presidential candidate George W. Bush, however these are not\r\nthe opinions of Red Herring Communications nor do they influence the\r\njournalistic ethics of any of the editorial properties of Red Herring\r\nCommunications,\" Perkins wrote. \"I apologize for the miscommunication and hope\r\nit did not cause any irritation or confusion.\"\r\n\r\n            \r\nPerkins has said that he will personally pay the $900 cost of the list rental\r\nto Red Herring Communications (which to some degree is the same as paying\r\nhimself, since he is the company's largest shareholder). Moreover, Perkins told\r\nthe New York Observer that he would record the expense as an in-kind\r\ncontribution to the Bush campaign. His apology e-mail, however, did not mention\r\nthis contribution, and as of Sept. 21, it had yet to show up on the Bush\r\ncampaign's online daily roster of campaign donations. The Bush campaign did not\r\nrespond to a request for comment.\r\n\r\n            \r\nPerhaps to avoid such sticky situations, some of Bush's presidential rivals are\r\nsteering clear of the e-fund-raising path--at least for now. Steve Forbes'\r\ncampaign accepts donations through its Web site and sends out thank you notes via e-mail to those\r\nwho contribute online--but that's all. \"We haven't done any e-mail fund raising\r\nat all,\" says Ben Gettler, a spokesman for the Forbes campaign, \"and we don't\r\nhave any plans to do so. We believe our Internet presence is good enough.\" Of\r\ncourse, Forbes is spending significant sums of his own money on the\r\npresidential campaign, making his fund-raising urgency arguably lower than that\r\nof other candidates.\r\n\r\n            Ultimately, says\r\nCampaigns & Elections ' Faucheaux, the electorate will become\r\naccustomed to unwanted e-mail solicitations, just as it is to political junk\r\nmail. \"As long as donors are comfortable with it being there, I don't see that\r\n[e-mail solicitations] have any particular problems,\" Faucheaux said.\r\n\"Remember: It's really in an experimental stage right now.\"\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n   \r\n"},"properties":[{"key":"SourceSystemId","values":["5YQLLGY4T2U4.OPX3P0XYZZPG@mimefactory.state.tld"]},{"key":"Sender","values":["{\"Name\":null,\"Address\":\"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev\",\"RoutingType\":\"SMTP\",\"MailboxType\":\"Mailbox\",\"Id\":null}"]},{"key":"IngestedFromMailbox","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"BirthId","values":["2b838748-10a1-4405-8560-bc9be6373b89"]},{"key":"SizeInKb","values":["13.427"]},{"key":"Sensitivity","values":["Official"]},{"key":"SensitivityAssigned","values":["TransitoryModified"]},{"key":"IsTransitory","values":["True"]},{"key":"AttachmentCount","values":["0"]},{"key":"IsCapstone","values":["False"]},{"key":"IsRecord","values":["True"]},{"key":"Classification","values":[""]},{"key":"MetadataGenerated","values":["2017-11-08T15:54:26.026747Z"]},{"key":"MetadataGeneratorVersion","values":["0.1.1107.1"]},{"key":"Source","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"SourceType","values":["EmailExchange"]},{"key":"DispositionType","values":["Transitory"]},{"key":"DispositionDate","values":["2018-11-06T23:56:40Z"]}],"security":{"securityDescriptors":["RECORD","OFFICIAL","eRecords"],"signatures":[]},"users":[{"userRoles":["From"],"id":122,"originalSmtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","smtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"firstName":"svcErecMbxPusher","userValidFrom":"2017-04-18T10:34:19.84","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\svcErecMbxPusher","orgUnit":"Enterprise
