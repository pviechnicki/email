Early observations by Rabl (cited by [ 3]) in\r\n        plants suggested a preferential polarization of\r\n        chromosomes, with their centromeres clustered at one end of\r\n        the nuclear envelope (the apical side) and the telomeres at\r\n        the opposite end (the basal side). More recently, evidence\r\n        from fluorescence \r\n        in situ hybridization (FISH) studies\r\n        in different systems has suggested that various genomic\r\n        loci can be found consistently in specific regions of the\r\n        nucleus [ 4], and that subnuclear location can be\r\n        correlated with gene activity [ 5]. Together with results\r\n        from real-time measurements with living cells [ 6], these\r\n        studies argue for a structured organization of\r\n        chromosomes.\r\n        The present model we have of chromatin organization\r\n        within the nucleus is a dynamic one, with 'territories' for\r\n        each chromosome defined by their relative location to each\r\n        other [ 7]. During the mitotic cycle, chromosomes are\r\n        duplicated in the S phase and pulled to the two daughter\r\n        cells during M phase. Chromosome territories are\r\n        re-established after cell division, and once the cell is\r\n        arrested in a long interphase, chromosome movement becomes\r\n        restricted again [ 8]. Some nucleus-to-nucleus variations\r\n        in the exact position of each locus relative to the rest of\r\n        the genome can be expected [ 9]. As some random\r\n        organization within each territory is possible [ 10], there\r\n        is also likely to be time-dependent positional differences\r\n        in the relative coordinates of each locus within a single\r\n        nucleus [ 11]. These predicted nucleus-to-nucleus\r\n        variations and the mobility of the established territories\r\n        within the nuclei of various cell types in eukaryotes\r\n        remain poorly defined in most systems.\r\n        So far, most \r\n        in situ studies of gene positioning\r\n        and changes in higher-order chromatin architecture have\r\n        been carried out using FISH. This method can produce\r\n        artifacts, however, because it requires the fixation and\r\n        permeabilization of cells and denaturation of chromatin\r\n        before hybridization with labeled single-strand probes [\r\n        12]. It is also very difficult to perform kinetic studies\r\n        with FISH to track the dynamics of chromatin movement in a\r\n        single nucleus. Recent advances in the application of green\r\n        fluorescent protein (GFP) as an \r\n        in vivo tag of specific chromosomal\r\n        regions promises to revolutionize our ability to observe\r\n        chromatin-based processes in near real-time [ 13]. This\r\n        technique, first established by Andrew Belmont and\r\n        collaborators [ 14], entails the construction of a fusion\r\n        protein between GFP and the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of a\r\n        known heterologous transcription factor. The binding site\r\n        for the DBD is multimerized into a concatameric array which\r\n        is then inserted into the genome of animal or yeast cells.\r\n        Expression of the GFP-DBD fusion protein results in\r\n        fluorescent tagging of the concatamer \r\n        in situ . This provides a 'beacon'\r\n        that allows one to track the position of this region in the\r\n        genome with high specificity and sensitivity. In yeast and\r\n        animal cells, a single concatamer insert can be visualized\r\n        with high resolution and fidelity, and the application of\r\n        this technique has provided new insights on chromosome\r\n        behavior [ 15, 16, 17].\r\n        These findings might, however, be true only for the few\r\n        cell types and yeast strains studied so far, and may not be\r\n        generally applicable to all eukaryotic cells. For example,\r\n        even though chromosome territories showed only small\r\n        movements during an observation period of several hours [\r\n        6], they may show larger movements over longer time periods\r\n        such as days. Also, the degree of nuclear order appears to\r\n        depend on the particular cell type [ 18]. Earlier\r\n        application of this technology in multicellular organisms\r\n        involved extrachromosomal arrays of the \r\n        lac operator created in \r\n        C. elegans by co-injecting plasmids\r\n        containing the operator array and GFP sequences along with\r\n        other constructs [ 19]. The samples were fixed for\r\n        immunological detection and the sizes as well as stability\r\n        of the arrays studied remain undefined. Thus, application\r\n        of that technique to study chromatin behavior may be rather\r\n        limited. Very recently, Vazquez \r\n        et al. [ 20] applied this technology\r\n        in dissected \r\n        Drosophila spermatocytes from animals\r\n        that have integrated the \r\n        lac operator arrays at\r\n        cytogenetically defined genomic loci. Real-time monitoring\r\n        of chromosome movement in this specialized cell type\r\n        indicated that progression through G2 dramatically\r\n        restricts the slower, long-range component of chromatin\r\n        movement. This study provided the first direct evidence for\r\n        cell-cycle control of chromatin movement and elegantly\r\n        illustrated the power of this technology in transgenic\r\n        organisms to facilitate the understanding of chromosome\r\n        behavior in a developmental context.\r\n        The model plant \r\n        Arabidopsis offers an excellent\r\n        system in which to apply this new technology for the study\r\n        of chromatin organization and dynamics. Aside from being\r\n        easily transformable and having a well characterized genome\r\n        [ 21], it is relatively easy to track cell types and\r\n        individual cells. One can easily distinguish one cell from\r\n        another, and individual cells can be tracked for a week or\r\n        more [ 22]. In the present work, we have successfully\r\n        adapted the 'GFP beacon' approach to create the necessary\r\n        tools and transgenic lines for visualizing stably inserted\r\n        concatameric sites in the genome in live \r\n        Arabidopsis plants. This material and\r\n        technology should open up new opportunities for\r\n        characterizing the physical organization and movement of\r\n        chromosomes in the nuclei of \r\n        Arabidopsis .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Results and discussion\r\n        \r\n          Vector construction and molecular characterization\r\n          of transgenic Arabidopsis\r\n          To control accumulation of \r\n          lac repressor (LacI) proteins in\r\n          plant nuclei, a glucocorticoid-inducible gene expression\r\n          system (pTA7002) was used for vector construction [ 23].\r\n          A gene encoding a plant-optimized GFP variant, \r\n          mGFP5 [ 24], was placed in frame\r\n          with a \r\n          LacI -SV40 nuclear localization\r\n          signal fusion ( \r\n          GFP-LacI/NLS ) [ 25] and then\r\n          subcloned into the vector pTA7002 under the control of\r\n          the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-responsive promoter near\r\n          the left border. The resulting plasmid is designated as\r\n          pEL700. At the other end of the pTA7002 vector, we\r\n          inserted 256 copies of the \r\n          lac operator sequence ( \r\n          LacOs , 10.1 kb) and designated\r\n          this second vector pEL702 (Figure 1a). The entire plasmid\r\n          of pEL702 encompasses about 25 kilobases (kb) and the\r\n          size of the integrating region flanked by the right and\r\n          left borders of the Ti plasmid is about 17 kb. The\r\n          plasmid was designed such that the DNA between the right\r\n          and left borders can be transferred into plant nuclei via\r\n          \r\n          Agrobacterium [ 26]. Thus, when\r\n          stable transgenic \r\n          Arabidopsis plants are treated with\r\n          the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex), the\r\n          expressed fusion proteins would be able to localize to\r\n          the integrated loci by association with \r\n          LacOs . This inducible expression\r\n          system allows controlled expression of a small amount of\r\n          GFP-LacI/NLS protein for optimal signal-to-noise and to\r\n          prevent aggregation of GFP fusion proteins in the nuclei\r\n          as a result of high protein concentrations. As Belmont\r\n          and co-workers [ 14, 25] reported that the \r\n          LacOs is unstable in a\r\n          recombination-competent bacterial strain, we are\r\n          concerned with the stability of \r\n          LacOs in the \r\n          Agrobacterium strain that is used\r\n          to transform \r\n          Arabidopsis . Thus, we examined the\r\n          stability of \r\n          LacOs in the \r\n          Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain\r\n          GV3101/MP90 by Southern blot analysis after\r\n          transformation. We found that the \r\n          LacOs may be unstable in \r\n          Agrobacterium initially, as many\r\n          colonies examined turned out to contain truncated arrays\r\n          that are less than 10.1 kb, the size of the original \r\n          LacOs in pEL702 (Figure 1b, lanes 1\r\n          and 2). We found, however, that colonies that do show the\r\n          proper size array can be maintained for at least 2 days\r\n          at 28?C in liquid culture without a significant reduction\r\n          of the array size (Figure 1b, lane 3). Thus, we first\r\n          monitored the size of \r\n          LacOs in our \r\n          Agrobacterium culture before\r\n          transforming \r\n          Arabidopsis with colonies carrying\r\n          full-length or near full-length \r\n          LacOs .\r\n          We observed low transformation efficiency of \r\n          Arabidopsis with \r\n          Agrobacterium carrying pEL702 under\r\n          our transformation conditions (<10% of that with\r\n          pEL700, data not shown). We speculate that a large T-DNA\r\n          region (approximately 17 kb) and/or the presence of a\r\n          large number of tandem repeats of \r\n          LacOs in the T-DNA region may\r\n          contribute to the low efficiency of gene transfer. After\r\n          we obtained several independent lines that grew on\r\n          selection plates containing hygromycin, we used Southern\r\n          blot analysis to determine the size of the \r\n          LacOs and the relative copy number\r\n          of the inserted T-DNAs in the transformed lines. \r\n          Pst I digestion of genomic DNA from\r\n          the transgenic lines, which should release the\r\n          full-length \r\n          LacOs (10.1 kb) from the integrated\r\n          T-DNA inserts, was hybridized with a probe consisting of\r\n          40 copies of the \r\n          lac operator sequence. Thus, in\r\n          this analysis, each fragment should correspond to the\r\n          size of an integrated \r\n          lac operator array.\r\n          We detected several bands of different apparent sizes\r\n          on the Southern blot (Figure 2), indicating that arrays\r\n          with different numbers of \r\n          lac operator sequences were\r\n          integrated into the genome in each of the lines examined.\r\n          Figure 2shows data from analysis of two independently\r\n          transformed lines. One line is designated EL702C and\r\n          showed hybridizing bands with apparent sizes of\r\n          approximately 10, 9 and 7 kb. The second is designated\r\n          EL702E and DNA from this line showed a single band of\r\n          approximately 4.5 kb that hybridized with the \r\n          lac operator probe. Southern\r\n          analysis with homozygous plants from the fifth-generation\r\n          progenies of both lines also showed similar signal(s)\r\n          (data not shown). These results indicated that the \r\n          LacOs could be truncated before or\r\n          during integration into the \r\n          Arabidopsis genome, but the\r\n          integrated genes were subsequently stable in the plant\r\n          genome. For simplicity, we will refer to the integration\r\n          site as a tagged locus.\r\n          The copy numbers of insertions in these lines were\r\n          estimated with restriction digests of genomic DNA using \r\n          Bgl II and \r\n          Hind III in addition to \r\n          Pst I, followed by Southern blot\r\n          analysis using the \r\n          LacI/NLS fragment as a probe\r\n          (Figures 1, 2). Using this probe, we should detect\r\n          fragments generated by enzymatic cleavage upstream of the\r\n          \r\n          LacI/NLS sequence in the inserts as\r\n          well as restriction sites present at variable distances\r\n          in the genomic DNA neighboring the left border of the\r\n          insertions. Thus, each fragment detected in the Southern\r\n          blot probably corresponds to a distinct copy of the\r\n          transferred DNA that has integrated into the genome.\r\n          Clustered integrations will, however, be more difficult\r\n          to analyze in cases where a large number of insertions\r\n          are present in the particular transgenic line and\r\n          digestions with multiple restriction enzymes will be\r\n          necessary to ascertain the structure of the insertion\r\n          loci. Our results from digestions with three different\r\n          restriction enzymes suggest that there are three\r\n          insertions in the EL702C line and a single insertion in\r\n          the EL702E line per haploid genome, consistent with the\r\n          data obtained with the \r\n          lac operator probe (Figure 2).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Dexamethasone-inducible expression of GFP fusion\r\n          protein\r\n          Western blot analysis with anti-GFP polyclonal\r\n          antibodies (Clonetech) was used to test inducibility of\r\n          GFP-LacI/NLS in transgenic plants. We analyzed homozygous\r\n          transgenic plants from two independent lines, EL702C and\r\n          EL702E, as well as a line from our control vector,\r\n          EL700S. This latter was transformed with pEL700, which is\r\n          identical to pEL702 except for the absence of \r\n          LacOs . As pEL700 does not contain\r\n          the \r\n          LacOs , the transgenic line EL700S\r\n          can be used as a negative control for specific\r\n          association of GFP-LacI/NLS with the \r\n          LacOs in our experimental system.\r\n          In this line, we expect the accumulation of GFP-LacI/NLS\r\n          proteins in the nuclei after induction but specific\r\n          binding of the fusion protein to chromatin should be\r\n          absent. We treated transgenic seedlings with an excess\r\n          concentration of Dex (30 ?M) in 10 ml water to achieve\r\n          uniform induction. Samples were collected at 0, 6, 12,\r\n          24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the treatment and proteins\r\n          were extracted in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-containing\r\n          buffer for immunological detection of GFP fusion\r\n          proteins.\r\n          We found that boiling the plant material in the\r\n          extraction buffer resulted in loss of all GFP signals on\r\n          our western blots. This appears to be a result of\r\n          aggregation of GFP-LacI/NLS fusion proteins with some\r\n          insoluble materials in plant cells as we do not encounter\r\n          this problem with recombinant GFP-LacI/NLS produced in\r\n          bacteria (data not shown). To circumvent this problem, we\r\n          omitted the heating step in our protein sample\r\n          preparation and anti-GFP cross-reacting proteins can be\r\n          readily detected in our assay. Western blot signals were\r\n          first detected 6 hours after the addition of Dex and\r\n          increased over time in all three lines (Figure 3). After\r\n          48 hours, the detection levels did not change\r\n          significantly and comparison between the three lines\r\n          revealed that the Dex-inducible system in each line\r\n          performed similarly with and without truncated \r\n          LacOs , and minimal leakiness of\r\n          the promoter was observed before induction. Although the\r\n          predicted size of GFP-LacI/NLS fusion protein is 67 kDa,\r\n          we detected several signals between 70 to 30 kDa in\r\n          addition to a major species of around 81 kDa on our blots\r\n          for all lines over time after 24 hours. The cause of this\r\n          size heterogeneity of our GFP fusion protein is unclear\r\n          at present.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          In situdetection of the tagged loci in transgenic\r\n          plants\r\n          We then examined nucleus labeling by GFP after Dex\r\n          treatment in homozygous transgenic plants from lines\r\n          EL702C and E (with \r\n          LacOs ), and line EL700S (without \r\n          LacOs ) by fluorescence microscopy.\r\n          Each line was collected at the same time points as for\r\n          the western blot analysis, and GFP fluorescence was\r\n          observed with appropriate filters. All lines examined\r\n          showed fluorescence in nuclei 6 hours after the treatment\r\n          (Figure 4, rows A). The intensities of GFP fluorescence\r\n          in nuclei were increased by 48 hours and stabilized after\r\n          48 hours in all lines. These responses were correlated\r\n          with the results of the western blot analysis. Both\r\n          western blot analysis and microscopy studies confirmed\r\n          that the \r\n          LacOs does not interfere with\r\n          glucocorticoid-inducible expression.\r\n          To investigate the response of the tagged loci, we\r\n          observed each nucleus with three-dimensional fluorescence\r\n          microscopy. If the system functions properly, we should\r\n          be able to detect the tagged loci as bright spots above\r\n          the GFP background signals in nuclei of the lines EL702C\r\n          and E, and should not detect any spot in line EL700S\r\n          because of the absence of \r\n          LacOs . Bright spots were clearly\r\n          observed above the diffused GFP fluorescence in nuclei\r\n          observed 24 h after induction in lines EL702C and E,\r\n          whereas significant fluorescence spots above the diffuse\r\n          background signals were not observed in EL700S (Figure 4,\r\n          rows B). The spots were detected with similar\r\n          signal-to-background ratios until the end of the time\r\n          course (96 h after induction) for lines EL702C and E,\r\n          whereas line EL700S did not show any spots during this\r\n          time course. The study also revealed that an array of\r\n          about 120 copies of the \r\n          lac operator sequence is sufficient\r\n          to visualize \r\n          LacOs in planta via GFP, as the\r\n          size of the \r\n          LacOs in the single inserted locus\r\n          in line EL702E is approximately 4.5 kb (Figure 2).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Inhibition of chimeric GFP-LacI/NLS protein binding\r\n          in situto LacOsby IPTG\r\n          To verify if the spots in nuclei correspond to the\r\n          tagged loci, we examined whether the detected subnuclear\r\n          localization of the expressed GFP-LacI/NLS fusion protein\r\n          is sensitive to isopropyl-?-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). As\r\n          the \r\n          lac repressor variant that we used\r\n          binds to the operator sites as dimers, we should be able\r\n          to inhibit its binding to the \r\n          LacOs of the tagged loci by adding\r\n          IPTG [ 27]. If the binding is specific to the \r\n          LacOs inserted in the genome, the\r\n          observed fluorescence spots should be suppressed by the\r\n          addition of IPTG.\r\n          We used homozygous plants from line EL702C, which\r\n          carries three copies of the T-DNA insert, for this\r\n          experiment. Forty microliters of solution containing 0.3\r\n          ?M of Dex and 100 mM IPTG were dropped on each seedling\r\n          on the culture plates. Guard cells in the stomata of\r\n          cotyledons were observed 12 hours after induction in the\r\n          presence or absence of IPTG and the results from observed\r\n          nuclei were tabulated (Figure 5a,b). Without IPTG, we\r\n          detected one spot in 15%, two spots in 65% and three\r\n          spots in 20% of total observed nuclei ( \r\n          n = 25) among three seedlings. With\r\n          IPTG, we detected no spots in 70% and one spot in 30% of\r\n          total observed nuclei ( \r\n          n = 25) in three seedlings. We also\r\n          tested protein accumulation levels in the specimens\r\n          examined by western blot analysis. Similar levels of\r\n          signals were detected with and without IPTG (Figure 5c),\r\n          thus indicating that \r\n          lac repressor binding is inhibited\r\n          by IPTG without change in protein accumulation levels.\r\n          This study shows that the observed fluorescence spots in\r\n          lines EL702C and E indeed correspond to specific binding\r\n          of the induced GFP-LacI/NLS fusion protein to the tagged\r\n          loci. However, the relationship between the spot numbers\r\n          and tagged loci is unclear at this point. For this\r\n          purpose, we are currently determining the precise genomic\r\n          location of the tagged loci and collecting the statistics\r\n          of spot numbers for homozygous and heterozygous plants of\r\n          line EL702C.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Detection and relational mapping of tagged loci\r\n          configuration\r\n          As plants contain chloroplasts in leaf and stem cells\r\n          and many autofluorescent compounds are localized in cell\r\n          walls, a signal-to-background ratio for GFP detection is\r\n          probably lower than in animal systems. Thus, higher\r\n          levels of accumulation of GFP-LacI/NLS may be required to\r\n          detect the loci in our system. Under this condition, we\r\n          found that we could obtain spatial information for\r\n          subnuclear structures with excess unbound GFP-LacI/NLS\r\n          fusion proteins. The nuclear contour as well as the shape\r\n          of the nucleolus, for which GFP-LacI/NLS has relatively\r\n          low accessibility and which thus appears as an opaque\r\n          object within the nucleus, can be captured along with the\r\n          tagged loci positions by single channel excitation. A\r\n          guard-cell nucleus from homozygous plants of line EL702C\r\n          is shown (Figure 6). The data can be converted to a\r\n          three-dimensional model shown for the detected spots\r\n          (shown as red objects) and the nucleolus (shown as a blue\r\n          object) within the nucleus (outline shown in green\r\n          wire-frame) (Figure 6b). The distance between the three\r\n          spots can also be easily determined with the existing\r\n          program of our system (Figure 6c).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Comparison of tagged loci between guard cells and\r\n          root epidermal cells\r\n          Plant organs are composed of ordered collections of\r\n          various cell types that differ in their shape, size,\r\n          function and DNA content. The positive correlation\r\n          observed in most cells between cell volume and the degree\r\n          of polyploidy indicates that the nuclear DNA content may\r\n          have a key role in controlling cell growth [ 28]. In \r\n          Arabidopsis , the ploidy level\r\n          varies from 2C (guard cells, sepal and petal epidermal\r\n          cells) to 64C (leaf trichomes) [ 29]. However, the\r\n          mechanism of endocycle control in plants remains poorly\r\n          understood. As an application of our chromatin-tagging\r\n          system, we show here that cell-specific polyploidy can be\r\n          observed directly with this technology without measuring\r\n          nuclear DNA content.\r\n          We used the homozygous plants of line EL702E, which\r\n          contain a single tagged locus, for this experiment. GFP\r\n          signals observed in a cotyledon guard cell (Figure 7a)\r\n          and an elongated root epidermal cell (Figure 7b) of a\r\n          10-day-old seedling were compared using three-dimensional\r\n          projections of their nuclei after Dex induction. In the\r\n          guard cell, where the shape of its nucleus is usually\r\n          flat or spherical, we often detected one spot, which\r\n          suggests that the tagged site is frequently paired with\r\n          its homolog. In contrast, in the elongated root epidermal\r\n          cells where the nucleus usually elongates at the two\r\n          opposite sides, we often detected multiple fluorescence\r\n          spots (five spots for the root nucleus shown in Figure\r\n          7), which indicates the polyploid nature of the observed\r\n          nuclei. Upon further refinement of this technology, one\r\n          may be able to study the dynamics and regulation of\r\n          endoreduplication in plant cells that contribute to\r\n          cell-specific ploidy differences.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Conclusions\r\n        We have established transgenic plants that enable us to\r\n        observe specific tagged genomic loci together with the\r\n        nucleolar location in cells of a living plant without any\r\n        fixation. Using this system, we have visualized GFP-tagged\r\n        chromatin in different cell types in living \r\n        Arabidopsis plants. GFP-tagged\r\n        chromosome observation has been applied in several studies\r\n        involving yeast, cultured animal cells and, more recently,\r\n        transgenic \r\n        Drosophila spermatocytes. These\r\n        studies have revealed new principles of chromosome dynamics\r\n        and organization. However, the relationship between\r\n        chromatin structure and cell types and developmental stages\r\n        is an important question that remains unanswered. The\r\n        intact \r\n        Arabidopsis seedlings that were used\r\n        for microscopy under our conditions remain viable after\r\n        transplanting to soil from the slides. Thus, it should be\r\n        possible to monitor the same plants continuously for up to\r\n        several weeks. In future, by marking individual cells with\r\n        visual tags it should be possible to follow changes in\r\n        nuclear shape as well as relative subnuclear position of\r\n        the nucleolus and specific tagged genomic loci over long\r\n        times-scales of the order of weeks. These types of studies\r\n        may reveal new aspects of chromatin organization in\r\n        relationship to developmental timing.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Materials and methods\r\n        \r\n          Gene constructions\r\n          \r\n          LacI/NLS (nuclear localization\r\n          signal from SV40 large T-antigen) [ 25] was fused to a\r\n          plant-optimized GFP sequence, \r\n          mGFP5 [ 24], and designated \r\n          mGFP5-LacI/NLS . \r\n          mGFP5-LacI/NLS was inserted into a\r\n          glucocorticoid-inducible expression vector pTA7002 [ 23]\r\n          and the resulting vector designated pEL700. \r\n          lac operator array, \r\n          LacOs (256-mer, 10.1 kb) [ 25] was\r\n          then inserted into pEL700 and the resulting vector\r\n          designated pEL702.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Agrobacteriumbinary vector preparation and Southern\r\n          blot analysis\r\n          After the \r\n          Agrobacterium culture (2 ml) was\r\n          collected by centrifugation in a microfuge, the pellet\r\n          was resuspended in a solution of 50 mM glucose, 25 mM\r\n          Tris and 10 mM ethylene aminotetraacetic acid (pH8.0).\r\n          Cell lysis solution (0.2 M sodium hydroxide and 1.0%\r\n          (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)), phenol and\r\n          neutralization solution (3 M sodium acetate (pH5.2)) were\r\n          then added to the resuspended cells in order, and the\r\n          solution was vortexed for a few seconds. After\r\n          centrifugation, the upper-phase solution was transferred\r\n          to a new tube, and the DNA precipitated with ethanol. The\r\n          DNA was dissolved in water and digested with \r\n          Pst I, and the digested DNA was\r\n          then separated in a 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel by\r\n          electrophoresis. The DNA was transferred to a membrane\r\n          (Zeta-probe GT genomic tested blotting membrane, Bio-Rad,\r\n          CA) with 0.4 M sodium hydroxide after treatment with 0.25\r\n          N hydrochloric acid as suggested by the manufacturer. The\r\n          membrane was prehybridized for 0.5 h at 65?C, hybridized\r\n          for 1 h at 65?C with random primer-labeled \r\n          lac operator concatamer (40 copies)\r\n          probe in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech\r\n          Laboratories, CA), and then washed at 60?C in washing\r\n          solution (0.1% (w/v) SDS, 15 mM sodium chloride, 1.5 mM\r\n          sodium citrate).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Transformation of Arabidopsis thalianaand Southern\r\n          blot analysis\r\n          \r\n          Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype\r\n          Columbia) plants were transformed by dipping the\r\n          influorescence of flowering plants into transformation\r\n          solution (5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.05% (v/v) Silwet L-77)\r\n          with \r\n          Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain\r\n          GV3101/MP90 transformed with pEL700 or pEL702. To\r\n          transform \r\n          A. thaliana with the \r\n          Agrobacterium carrying pEL702,\r\n          independent \r\n          Agrobacterium colonies were first\r\n          grown for 12 h in several different culture tubes with 2\r\n          ml culture medium. One milliliter from each of the\r\n          cultures was allocated to measure the size of the \r\n          LacOs . The \r\n          LacOs size in \r\n          Agrobacterium was analyzed by\r\n          Southern blots with a probe of 40 copies of the \r\n          lac operator. The cultures in which\r\n          full-length or near full-length \r\n          LacOs was found to be maintained\r\n          were then increased to 500 ml and incubated at 28?C for\r\n          12 h before use for \r\n          Arabidopsis transformation. \r\n          LacOs size and copy numbers were\r\n          assayed by hybridization of two gene-specific probes\r\n          separately to genomic DNA extracted from transgenic \r\n          Arabidopsis . The first probe was a\r\n          random primer-labeled 40 copies of the \r\n          lac operator. The second was the\r\n          random primer-labeled \r\n          LacI/NLS . Membranes were\r\n          prehybridized for 0.5 h at 65?C, hybridized for 1 h at\r\n          65?C in ExpressHyb hybridization solution and washed at\r\n          60?C in washing solution.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Western blot analysis\r\n          Samples for western blot analysis were ground in\r\n          liquid nitrogen. Extraction buffer (10%(v/v) glycerol,\r\n          10% (v/v) ?-mercaptoethanol, 5% (w/v) SDS) was added\r\n          immediately to the samples. After 5 min incubation on\r\n          ice, the mixture was centrifuged in a microfuge to remove\r\n          insoluble material. Ten microliters of non-heated\r\n          supernatant was used for western blot analysis and\r\n          Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining after\r\n          SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Anti-GFP\r\n          polyclonal antibodies (Clontech) were used at 1/5,000\r\n          dilution to detect mGFP5-LacI/NLS proteins. Protein\r\n          amounts in each sample were qualitatively compared in CBB\r\n          dye staining SDS-polyacrylamide gel and normalized before\r\n          use for western blot analysis.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Growth of Arabidopsis thaliana\r\n          Surface-sterilized seeds were germinated on 0.5?

Healthily\r\n          growing plants were transplanted to the soil in small\r\n          pots and grown until seeds were obtained in the plant\r\n          growth chamber.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sample preparation for microscopy\r\n          Surface-sterilized seeds were germinated on 0.5?

MS agar plates and 40 ?l of a\r\n          0.3 ?M dexamethasone (Dex) solution was then dropped on\r\n          each seedling. After 10-12 h, the seedlings were placed\r\n          in between two coverslips with water. The coverslips were\r\n          then placed on the microscope stage of our imaging\r\n          set-up. When time course experiments were performed, 1-\r\n          to 2-week-old seedlings were placed in Petri dishes (60 ?\r\n          15 mm) and 10 ml water containing 30 ?M Dex was added.\r\n          The dishes were slowly shaken until seedlings were\r\n          collected. Three seedlings from each time point were\r\n          collected for western blot analyses.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Fluorescence microscopy\r\n          A DeltaVision restoration microscope system (Applied\r\n          Precision, WA) equipped with a TE200 microscope (Nikon)\r\n          was used to observe nuclei in induced seedlings. Forty\r\n          images at 0.2 ?m Z-steps were collected using a Nikon\r\n          PlanApo 60?, 1.2 N.A. water-immersion objective lens. The\r\n          exposure times were 0.3-3 sec. The filters used are\r\n          exciter: 436 nm/10 nm, emitter: 470 nm/30 nm and JP4\r\n          beamsplitter (Chroma, VT). When larger areas of root\r\n          epidermal tissues were observed, a TE200 microscope\r\n          equipped with a Nikon PlanFluor 20?, 0.45 N.A. objective\r\n          lens and a 3CCD camera (DEI-750, Optronics, CA) was\r\n          used.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Image processing\r\n          The stacked images of nuclei were analyzed by softWoRx\r\n          software (Applied Precision) on an Octane Workstation\r\n          (Silicon Graphics, CA).
