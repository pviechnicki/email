He told the Jakarta Post , \"The Indonesian Army will not stand\r\nstill if our territory's borderlines are breached.\" (For a Timor primer, click\r\n).\r\n\r\n            On the\r\neve of Monday's withdrawal of Indonesian troops from East Timor, the\r\nStraits\r\nTimes of Singapore reported that in their last days on the island,\r\nIndonesian soldiers were seen selling what appeared to be either looted goods\r\nor redirected foreign aid at \"exorbitant prices\" to \"needy East Timorese.\" The\r\npaper said, \"Whatever the source, it was clear that food was being sold to the\r\nhighest bidder--and those with the right credentials. East Timorese who sided\r\nwith pro-independence militias were either ignored or sold goods at sky-high\r\nprices.\"\r\n\r\n            Less\r\nthan a week after the murder in Dili of a Dutch journalist, British member of\r\nParliament and former BBC war correspondent Martin Bell called on the press to\r\nvoluntarily reduce their numbers in East Timor. In a column in the\r\nIndependent on Sunday , he said, \"The peacekeepers have better things to\r\ndo with their limited resources\" than to protect journalists. He also claimed\r\nthat the number of news-gatherers in areas of conflict has become\r\n\"unmanageable. News events get distorted under the weight of them. They bring\r\nan unacceptable increase in the risk of casualties from land mines, sniper fire\r\nand brigandage.\"\r\n\r\n            Many\r\npapers around the world contrasted China's ambiguous response to last week's\r\nearthquake in Taiwan with Greece's no-strings-attached aid to rival Turkey\r\nafter that nation's August temblor. The South China Morning Post of Hong Kong reported that Taiwanese officials accused China of slowing\r\ninternational rescue efforts by refusing permission to fly through mainland\r\nairspace. A Russian mission, for example, was forced to avoid China and to take\r\nan air route via Siberia, causing a 12-hour delay. The paper also said that\r\nBeijing has been asserting its sovereignty claim by \"thanking foreign donors\r\nfor offering help to 'our country's Taiwan area.' \" Another attack on China's\r\nhumanitarian response came in the Jerusalem Post , which claimed that when Taiwan told China\r\nthat it needed cash donations rather than rescue assistance, the mainland's Red\r\nCross offered a mere $100,000 in cash and $60,000 in relief goods: \"small\r\nindeed, when compared with the $50 million Taiwan has given to help\r\nflood-victims in China in recent years.\"\r\n\r\n            The\r\nRussian air force bombed the Chechen city of Grozny over the weekend in what\r\nthe International Herald\r\nTribune described as an attempt to \"destroy Islamic militants\r\nbased in Chechnya.\" The militants have twice invaded the neighboring Russian\r\nregion of Dagestan in the last month and are thought to be responsible for the\r\napartment bombings that have killed 300 people in Moscow and other Russian\r\ncities. The Russian daily Kommersant said that the air raids show that\r\n\"Russia will no longer capitulate to Chechnya but will only speak in the\r\nlanguage of force\" and concluded the raids have rendered the Chechen leadership\r\n\"less bellicose.\"\r\n\r\n            An\r\nop-ed in the St. Petersburg Times by a Russian academic proposed a bold\r\nsolution to the Russian-Chechen conflict: Grant the territory independence.\r\nCalling the Chechnya uprising an \"act of banditism\" and a \"civil war,\" Boris\r\nKagarlitsky said that independence for Chechnya would clarify the situation and\r\nmake it much easier to resolve. \"If we do declare Chechnya independent, we can\r\ncreate a real border between Chechnya and Russia, ... that we can give\r\ninternational status. Such a border would be easy to fortify and control. It\r\nwould also be easy to close. ... Likewise, our government would have to\r\nguarantee full equality and respect for the civil rights of Chechens who choose\r\nRussia as their place of residence. Today, Chechens in Russia don't have any\r\nclear status. Against such a background, there is an anti-Caucasian hysteria,\r\nwhich holds any person from that region responsible for the actions of soldiers\r\nin the hills of Dagestan. Racist paranoia doesn't distinguish between rebel\r\nfighters and salespeople in the marketplaces.\"\r\n\r\n            Microsoft co-founder Paul\r\nAllen's forthcoming Experience Music Project in Seattle could be in trouble if its\r\nBritish equivalent is anything to go by. The National Centre for Popular Music\r\nopened in Sheffield in March but is already threatened with closure after\r\nattracting fewer than half the visitors it expected. The Sunday Times\r\nsaid the museum was seen as \"vital in helping the city to shake off its Full\r\nMonty image of dying industry and unemployment.\" However, the museum is\r\nsaid to be too expensive and has been attacked for playing down the \"sex and\r\ndrugs\" aspects of rock. \"It is all a bit innocent,\" Jenny Frankel told the\r\nTimes . \"You can get round it in about an hour, and you expect a bit more\r\nthan that for ?7.95 [$12.50].\"\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
