They now","priority":"Normal","contentType":"multipart/alternative","sentDate":"2017-11-06T23:56:30","importance":"Normal","plainTextBody":"\r\n   \r\n   \r\n      \r\n         \r\n            Signs and Wonders\r\n\r\n            Are they loathsome, or do\r\nthey attest to the indomitability of the human spirit? They infiltrate every\r\ncorner of our consciousness, but do we understand them? Let us begin with the\r\nact of exuberance that defines the genre:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Raising the Roof: A\r\ntwo-armed, palms-skyward pump. A handstand standing up. The implication: That\r\nplay was so unbelievable I must raise the roof of this arena to contain the\r\ncollective excitement I've generated. Paternity remains contested: Some credit\r\nDallas Cowboy Emmitt Smith with the first Roof-Raising, in the 1996 Super Bowl.\r\nOthers ascribe it to a high-school basketball player in a McDonald's\r\nAll-America game. Various collegiate teams playing various sports claim\r\nownership. Raising the Roof is the celebratory sports gesture of the\r\nmoment. Like all inspired sports gestures, it's moved beyond sports. Everybody\r\ndoes it--pro athletes and college athletes, talk-show hosts and talk-show\r\naudiences.\r\n\r\n            But to\r\ntrace the lineage of Raising the Roof, one must understand the history of the\r\nsports gesture itself. One must go back to a time few of us can remember. A\r\ntime before ...\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               The High-Five: A gesture so ubiquitous\r\nthat it's hard to imagine what else people could have done, it wasn't invented\r\nuntil 1980. Its architect was Derek Smith, a forward on the University of\r\nLouisville's championship basketball team. When asked why he and teammates had\r\ninvented this elevated palm slap, Smith replied, \"We decided to be a little\r\nodd.\" But how odd can the High-Five seem now? Like the ripped dungaree, the\r\nHigh-Five has swept the nation and been duly coopted. True rebels have been\r\nforced to forge new, more exotic gestures.\r\n\r\n            Thus the\r\n'80s saw \"the Fun Bunch\" (four Washington Redskins receivers) choreographing a\r\nleaping High-Five quartet. New York Jets defender Mark Gastineau performed a\r\nTwyla Tharpish \"Sack Dance\" after tackles. Yet, all these lacked the elegant\r\neconomy of the High-Five. All, that is, until ...\r\n\r\n            \r\n               The Monster Bash: A collision of hard-muscled,\r\npop-veined forearms, which briefly form an \"X\" upon impact. A barbaric\r\ncrunching of radius and ulna bones. The Bash began in baseball, and it went\r\neverywhere. Its progenitors: Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco, brutish sluggers\r\nfor the 1988 Oakland A's. After each home run (and there were many), the A's\r\nwould meet at the plate for Monster Bashing. Within a month of the Bash's\r\ninvention, the A's marketing department had cooked up a song. The lyrics\r\nfeatured a challenge to the Bash's ancestor: \"If you're a big fan of the\r\nOakland A's/ You, too, can do the latest ballpark craze/ When the A's big bats\r\nreally come alive/ Don't waste time with the boring High-Five.\"\r\n\r\n            \r\n               The Ickey Shuffle: A hulking touchdown jig. Ickey\r\nWoods, fullback for the Cincinnati Bengals, debuted this masterpiece in the\r\nfall of 1988. The NFL banned celebratory displays, in part as a reaction to the\r\nShuffle, but Ickey would not be repressed--and the fans loved him. So actually\r\nordered Ickey to keep dancing (albeit on the sidelines). Soon, Ickey added a\r\npost-Shuffle, hip-rolling \"Woo-Woo-Woo\" dance, for which Bengals defensive\r\nbacks joined him. By January 1989, when the Bengals reached the playoffs, what\r\nhad begun as a struggle for individual expression ended in an avalanche of\r\nconformity.\r\n\r\n            In the '90s, gesture\r\nartists sold out. They now seek the public's embrace and are aided by the\r\nwildfire spread new gestures enjoy when shown on ESPN's SportsCenter .\r\nOne need only see ...\r\n\r\n            \r\n               The City-Boy Bounce: An arch-backed, fists-clenched\r\nshoulder jiggle, sometimes paired with a zombielike trance-walk. Tradition\r\nholds it started on playgrounds in New York. Popular mostly with football and\r\nbasketball players. The Bounce is perhaps the best-looking gesture of all, but\r\nit is also the hardest to perform. It requires a level of fluidity not commonly\r\nseen in nonathletes. In this sense, the Bounce is a gesture for elitists, and\r\nthus a glaring counterpoint to ...\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               The Lambeau Leap: A jubilant vault into\r\nthe stands of Green Bay's Lambeau Field. Invented in 1993: After a big\r\ninterception, Packers safety Leroy Butler . The populist Leap is particularly\r\nsuited to the NFL's only publicly owned team, the zealously beloved Pack.\r\nPlayers express their appreciation to the Lambeau fans by hurtling into their\r\nmidst, for just one moment becoming one of them.\r\n\r\n            The Leap\r\nreached its zenith with the Packers' Super Bowl win last season. This season's\r\nhot new gesture?\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               The Mile-High Salute: Military tradition\r\nturned football celebration. A basic salute to teammates after touchdowns.\r\nCreators: the Denver Broncos' running backs, who unveiled the salute at\r\npreseason games this summer. A gesture clearly suited to football's warlike\r\nnature, the Salute is named for Denver's Mile High Stadium. The Broncos have\r\ninvited their fans to join in, creating a stadium saluting in unison and\r\nmarking the pinnacle of the football culture's fascistic tendencies.\r\n\r\n            The\r\nSalute developed into a stadiumwide event, but several other gestures have been\r\ndesigned specifically for a herd of 60,000 sports fans. These include:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               The Wave: Generally traced to 1984 and the Seattle\r\nKingdome, though some insist it dates to a 1983 University of Michigan football\r\ngame. Fans standing at appropriate moments fashion a group undulation.\r\nParticularly frustrating for abstainers: A cry of \"down in front\" will not\r\ndampen a rollicking Wave, so sight lines are blocked at regular time intervals.\r\nThe Wave remains popular, though not as controversial as ...\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               The Tomahawk Chop: A robotic\r\nhacking--only the forearm moves. Often accompanied by an outsized foam tomahawk\r\nand a \"Native American chant.\" The Chop gained mass attention when the Atlanta\r\nBraves went to the 1991 World Series, but it actually originated with fans of\r\nthe Florida State Seminoles. Native American groups hate the Chop, but former\r\nPresident Jimmy Carter defended it in 1991: \"With the Braves on top, we have a\r\nbrave, courageous and successful team, and I think we can look on the American\r\nIndians as brave, successful and attractive. So I don't look on it as an\r\ninsult.\"\r\n\r\n            Though\r\nless controversial, the most bizarre gesture of all remains ...\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               The Octopus Toss: In celebratory\r\nmoments, fans of the Detroit Red Wings throw real octopuses onto the ice. The\r\ntradition began in 1952, when teams needed eight playoff victories to win the\r\nStanley Cup. An octopus has eight arms (and smells awful). At times, more than\r\n50 octopuses rain down at once. Another time-honored crowd activity occurs if\r\nrink workers refuse to pick up the cephalopods with their bare hands--the crowd\r\nboos them.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
