NYU's ranking of Jonathan Schell's 1982 book The Fate of\r\nthe Earth --an overheated and self-edifying prophesy of nuclear disaster--at\r\nNo. 59, inspired Michael Kinsley to \r\n                  Slate\r\n                readers in naming the\r\ncentury's 100 Silliest Books Taken Seriously (By Serious People).\r\n\r\n            Although we received a wide variety of entries,\r\nconsensus emerged around these eight books and authors, in this order:\r\n\r\n            1. The Greening of America , by Charles\r\nReich\r\n\r\n            2. Earth in the Balance , by Al Gore\r\n\r\n            3. The Bell Curve , by Richard Herrnstein and\r\nCharles Murray\r\n\r\n            4. Das Kapital , by Karl Marx\r\n\r\n            5. The Population Bomb , by Paul Ehrlich\r\n\r\n            6. The End of History , by Francis\r\nFukuyama\r\n\r\n            7. Mein Kampf , by Adolph Hitler\r\n\r\n            8. Various works of Ayn\r\nRand\r\n\r\n            What makes a book silly? Some readers selected books that\r\nstate the obvious: Bill Gates' The Road Ahead (\"Computers will be\r\nimportant in the future--gosh!\" writes Tim Evans). Gore's Earth in the\r\nBalance was accused of both fuzzy thinking and naked political promotion.\r\nOthers nominated titles whose silliness was revealed by time, public debunking,\r\nor both. The easy winner--and easy target--in this category is Ehrlich's 1976\r\nThe Population Bomb , a neo-Malthusian tract, which predicted a\r\npopulation explosion that would cause global shortages, raise prices, poison\r\nthe environment, and lower life expectancy. Ehrlich's theories lost steam after\r\nhe lost a famous 1980 bet with economist Julian Simon, who wagered that any\r\nbasket of resources Ehrlich might name would be cheaper at any date in the\r\nfuture. Nonetheless, Ehrlich's book was treated to a 21 st\r\nanniversary reprinting in 1997.\r\n\r\n            Our more aggressive respondents, excited to nail\r\nentire bodies of work in one go, bypassed books and went straight for the\r\nauthors themselves. Ayn Rand garnered the most votes for any single author. A\r\nsampling of other targets:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Kathryn Harrison (\"I can think of\r\nno other writer I'd rather unilaterally disarm,\" fumes Adam Mazmanian);\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Gore Vidal (\"the consummate\r\npseudo-intellectual who disguises his bilious prejudices as profound insight,\"\r\nwrites David Greenberg);\r\n\r\n            and the entire Michel\r\nFoucault canon (\"or should I say oeuvre ?\" asks Ken Baker).\r\n\r\n            Others took a more literal approach to silliness. \"I\r\nsuppose Alice in Wonderland is not exactly what you meant,\" writes\r\nAndrew Solovay. Maybe not, but you illustrate beautifully our point about\r\ninterpreting standards.\r\n\r\n            Second, what did we mean by seriousness? Some\r\nreaders measured it by amount of attention devoted by the chattering classes on\r\nthe pages of prestigious periodicals. Reich's The Greening of America --a\r\ncelebration of the hippie ethos--debuted around the same time as the New\r\nYork Times op-ed page and dominated that forum for weeks. Other answers\r\ninterpreted seriousness--well, more seriously, mentioning Das Kapital ,\r\nMein Kampf , and Mao's Little Red Book for their enormous impacts\r\nrelative to their shaky intellectual foundations. Reader Jeff Staiman argues,\r\n\"People devoted their lives to [ Das Kapital ], set up national economies\r\nand whole countries based on it. Of course, only a minority believed in it\r\ndeeply, but many of them were serious people.\" He adds, \"if any group is more\r\nshrilly serious than the few hard-core socialists I met at Berkeley, I hope\r\nnever to meet them.\"\r\n\r\n            Like NYU's list, \r\n                  Slate\r\n               'slist has only\r\ntwo discernible effects: It validates already popular opinions (Did you already\r\nthink Reich's book deserved a comeuppance? Well, others did too.), and it makes\r\nthe authors feel very bad (or in the NYU list's case, very good) about their\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n            Actually, our list does\r\nprovide one more, far more practical, service: It should serve as grave warning\r\nto anyone who is even remotely contemplating writing a book on the fate of the\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               --Jodi Kantor\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               More Fellas for\r\nHillary\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Seven days ago,\r\nChatterbox asked readers who Hillary Clinton should date if she and the\r\npresident ever split (\"\").
