Happily,\r\n        many destinations in Malaysia offer a key activity travelers will be\r\n        searching for, such as exploring Malaysia?s culture and history or\r\n        engaging in a sport like fishing, but often there is an added bonus: a\r\n        nearby jungle for trekking or a beachside resort???and this is true\r\n        throughout the country.\r\n        Malaysia?s well developed transportation\r\n        infrastructure???both road and air???also offers the chance to step\r\n        away from rigid planning if you desire to stay an extra day by the\r\n        beach or want to do some more extensive shopping. Caution is needed if\r\n        you are not used to a hot and humid climate (a constant but not\r\n        necessarily hostile factor), and often requires a little extra planning\r\n        when heading out on tour, trekking, or just lazing by the pool.\r\n        At the back of the book, our helpful A to Z section provides\r\n        detailed practical information on how to handle your stay in Malaysia.\r\n        Here we provide some general touring strategies before describing the\r\n        places you will be visiting.\r\n        Some Touring Strategies\r\n        Starting in Town\r\n        The towns hold a mirror to Malaysia?s ethnic blend of Malay,\r\n        Chinese, Indians, and Eurasians, living side by side or in their\r\n        separate neighborhoods. This takes on a metropolitan dimension in Kuala\r\n        Lumpur. (In true Malaysian style, we will refer to the capital by its\r\n        abbreviation, KL. ) The northeast coast of Malaysia, especially between\r\n        Kota Bharu and Kuantan, is one of the best places to see traditional\r\n        Malay life with its rich Muslim culture, particularly evident in the\r\n        kampungs (villages) of the interior. Step back into Malaysia?s history\r\n        in the port towns of Melaka or Kota Kinabalu, where colonial rivals\r\n        once battled for supremacy, and where princes and sultans dealt in\r\n        palace intrigue. You will also be caught by the beauty of the many\r\n        mosques, temples, churches, and shrines as the country?s faithful\r\n        practice their beliefs, their places of homage often existing within\r\n        steps of each other in harmony. But remember when visiting places of\r\n        worship to dress in an appropriately dignified manner and to slip off\r\n        your shoes before entering a mosque or a Hindu temple. In Melaka,\r\n        observe the way of life of the Babas, the oldest Chinese community, and\r\n        its more modern manifestation in Penang???or indeed elsewhere, as\r\n        Chinatowns throughout Malaysia offer chances to explore, browse, or\r\n        buy.\r\n        The museums, while being few in number, provide an excellent\r\n        chance to gain insight into the path the country has taken, as well as\r\n        offering a sense of the country?s culture and folklore. The major ones\r\n        are in KL, Melaka, Penang, Kuching, and Kota Kinabalu. And the picture\r\n        of life on the peninsula is best completed with a visit to Singapore?s\r\n        national museum, if you happen to be passing through.\r\n        Heading Out to the Country\r\n        Beyond city limits you will find myriad opportunities to\r\n        enjoy the rural and forested Malaysia. But finding your way around the\r\n        riches of rainforest, coral reef, or marine reserve can be bewildering\r\n        if you plunge in unprepared. Unless you already have some experience in\r\n        the region, we recommend that you use the services of the many\r\n        first-class local tour operators. For jungle tours, they provide\r\n        experienced English-speaking guides, most of them with a good knowledge\r\n        of the rainforest. Offices of the Malaysian Tourist Development\r\n        Corporation in your home country can provide guidance to the most\r\n        reputable companies (see page 190). Most operators have their\r\n        headquarters in KL and organize tours nationwide. They may sub-contract\r\n        to smaller but equally reliable companies in outlying regions.\r\n        Malaysia has done a fine job of giving visitors access to\r\n        its natural treasures without ?taming? them too much. At the heart of\r\n        the peninsula, the huge Taman Negara gives you the most comprehensive\r\n        view of the country?s animals and plants in their wild state. A more\r\n        ?compact? approach is possible on the islands, notably with excursions\r\n        into the wilderness of Tioman or Langkawi. If you are attracted by the\r\n        egg-laying habits of turtles, head for Rantau Abang in July and\r\n        August.\r\n        On the island of Borneo, the great natural attractions are\r\n        Sarawak?s caves at Niah and Mulu, river cruises with a visit to tribal\r\n        longhouses, Sabah?s national parks of Mount Kinabalu and the offshore\r\n        islands, and the Sepilok wildlife sanctuary. If your desire is to\r\n        escape the coastal heat, highland retreats will refresh and invigorate,\r\n        offering a chance to enjoy what was once the exclusive domain of\r\n        colonial administrators.\r\n        And Then the Beach\r\n        White sandy beaches and gentle sea breezes are for many the\r\n        perfect recipe for a holiday from the stresses of modern life, and in\r\n        Malaysia the offerings are plenty. Whether on the Peninsula or at the\r\n        marine parks of Sabah and Sarawak, you?ll find many opportunities to\r\n        bask and laze under the tropical sun. (Just remember to use\r\n        sunscreen???sunburn and possible dehydration are never too far away.\r\n        )\r\n        On the west coast the best beaches are at the island\r\n        resorts of Penang and Langkawi. Unspoiled stretches of fine sand can\r\n        also be found on the east coast, from Pantai Chinta Berahi, north of\r\n        Kota Bharu, down to Beserah, north of Kuantan. Farther south are the\r\n        resorts of Tioman Island and Desaru. In East Malaysia, Kuching and Kota\r\n        Kinabalu both have fine hotel resorts.\r\n        Speaking the Language\r\n        Though the official tongue is Malay, or Bahasa Malaysia,\r\n        English is still the common language of communication between Malays,\r\n        Chinese, and Indians. After an initial nationalist resistance to using\r\n        English to accompany Malay road signs, a new effort is being made to\r\n        accommodate foreign drivers. But you may still like to use a few words\r\n        of Malay as a courteous gesture to your hosts.\r\n        You will find a comprehensive list of useful phrases in the\r\n        back of this book.\r\n        The Center\r\n        Malaysia?s prosperity in recent decades is most evident in\r\n        the central region of the peninsula, where the signs abound. From the\r\n        new international airport to KL?s dramatic skyline to the middle class\r\n        seen driving Malaysian-made Proton sedans on six-lane highways???all\r\n        are evidence to the country?s rising economic maturity. But even as a\r\n        new light rail system wends its way through the capital, progress has\r\n        not entirely buried the past under chrome and concrete. Still thriving\r\n        are the old commercial areas which brought so much of the wealth to the\r\n        city and country generally.\r\n        Beyond KL, the British colonial past???whose structures now\r\n        more often stand in the shadow of KL?s new skyscrapers???continues to\r\n        echo amid the northern hill stations. Here amid the cool afternoon\r\n        breezes or gentle mountain mists of the Cameron Highlands, the English\r\n        palate for tea (on a plantation scale?) and strawberries still thrive.\r\n        Those retreats within easier reach of the city???the casino of the\r\n        Genting Highlands or theme parks born out of former tin mines???draw\r\n        Malaysian families for holiday entertainment, a far cry from the more\r\n        traditional parks, zoos, and aquariums.\r\n        Commerce and industry line the way to the port city of\r\n        Klang on the coast, while Ipoh is Perak state?s most flourishing tin\r\n        town, and Kuala Kangsar is the leisurely, royal state capital. The vast\r\n        Taman Negara, which translates as ?national park,? is one of the best\r\n        preserved primary rainforests in the world, at once accessible to the\r\n        public and lovingly protective of its plants and wildlife.\r\n        Kuala Lumpur\r\n        At times Kuala Lumpur???often referred to as KL???appears\r\n        to be a criss-cross of pedestrian-unfriendly overpasses and\r\n        expressways. But the city opens to islands of almost jungle-like\r\n        tree-cover before descending again into lively market centers\r\n        surrounded by the buildings that look down upon the city?s busy\r\n        streets. Visitors may initially be drawn to the 88-story Petronas Twin\r\n        Towers or the KL Communications Tower, which are potent symbols of\r\n        modern Kuala Lumpur. But the more fascinating splendors of the past are\r\n        closer to street level, where distinctive Neo-Gothic styles are\r\n        beautifully preserved.\r\n        As in other Malaysian cities, the population is\r\n        predominantly Chinese. The Chinese community is prominent in the modern\r\n        business world. Chinatown itself remains a hive of bustling activity,\r\n        standing cheek by jowl with a Little India of pungent spice shops and\r\n        ornate Hindu temples. Ethnic Malays are present in the upper echelons\r\n        of the government, civil service, and tourist offices.\r\n        The Historic Center\r\n        KL?s main historic quarter lies near Jalan Sultan\r\n        Hishamuddin, where on the east side of the broad avenue is the Sultan\r\n        Abdul Samad Building. The handsome crypto-Moorish Federal Secretariat,\r\n        now the Supreme Court, was begun in 1894 (finished in 1897) and capped\r\n        with three fine copper onion-domes. One tops a 40-m- (120-ft-) high\r\n        clock tower that suggests inspiration from Big Ben in London. That is\r\n        perhaps not a surprise, since the building was designed by British\r\n        architect A. C. Norman. At the other end of this building you?ll also\r\n        find Infokraf, where the Malaysian Handicraft Development Corporation\r\n        has a permanent exhibition of national craftwork, with many exhibits\r\n        for sale. Near this building is the old City Hall, at Lebuh Pasar\r\n        Besar, which now houses the Textile Museum.\r\n        Among the many impressive skyscrapers, one of the most\r\n        striking is the 35-story Dayabumi Complex (1970), southeast of Dataran\r\n        Merdeka. The soaring white tower successfully integrates traditional\r\n        Islamic architectural themes???pointed arches, delicate open\r\n        tracery???with its otherwise modern design. Included in the\r\n        southernmost end of the complex is the adjoining Pejabat Besar Pos\r\n        (General Post Office), in a similar Islamic modern style, and a\r\n        shopping mall.\r\n        On the western side of the boulevard is the Dataran Merdeka\r\n        (Freedom Square). In the colonial days, the sound of a cricket bat?s\r\n        willow would have been heard as the afternoon?s sun-rays stretched\r\n        across the field. It was here that members of the mock-Tudor Royal\r\n        Selangor Club (1884), also designed by A. C. Norman, took time off from\r\n        the affairs of the Empire to play cricket. On the wide span of lawn the\r\n        cheers of independence were heard on 31 August 1957. The square now\r\n        hosts National Day state parades. On the square?s northern side, the\r\n        Anglican St. Mary?s Church dates to 1893.\r\n        A. C. Norman was rivaled in commissions by A. B. Hubback,\r\n        whose work is reflected in the Malaysian Railway buildings and\r\n        headquarters, located south on Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin. The main\r\n        station (completed in 1911 and extensively renovated in 1986) resembles\r\n        nothing so much as a gleaming sultan?s palace and is more attractive\r\n        than the somber brown headquarters building across the street. It is a\r\n        fine example of Moorish architecture, reflecting the Ottoman and Mogul\r\n        glory of the 13th and 14th centuries. The north wing was bombed in\r\n        World War II, and the second floor was gutted by fire in 1968.\r\n        Mr. Hubbock also designed the Masjid Jamek. Since 1909 this\r\n        building has marked the confluence of the Gombak and Klang Rivers,\r\n        where tin miners loaded supplies to be sent upriver and unloaded their\r\n        tin for shipment west to Port Klang, and where the city?s roots were\r\n        set down. It was designed in 1907 by Hubback in an Indian Moghul style:\r\n        three-pointed domes over the prayer hall, two minarets and balustrades\r\n        above an arcade of cusped arches???the whole predominantly gleaming\r\n        white, with pink terracotta brick.\r\n        Across the river going east from the Dayabumi Complex is\r\n        the old Pasar Seni (Central Market), set in an attractive Art-Deco\r\n        building (1936) in pastel blue and pink with a bold, bright skylit roof\r\n        over a buff-tiled floor. Clothes and Malaysian arts and crafts have\r\n        replaced the fish, meat, and vegetables that used to be sold here, but\r\n        the fine old marble counters have not been touched.\r\n        Chinatown\r\n        Away from the expressways and southeast from the Central\r\n        Market lie the exotic offerings of Chinatown, within the boundaries of\r\n        Jalan Sultan, Jalan Bandar (now known as Jalan Tun H. S. Lee), and\r\n        especially along Jalan Petaling. You will find everything from Chinese\r\n        apothecaries who display their herbs and medicines in porcelain jars to\r\n        Nepalese traders offering exotic jewelry, from fortune-tellers to pet\r\n        shops.\r\n        At night, when Jalan Petaling is closed to traffic, the\r\n        area comes alive, giving way to peddlers selling watches (bewildering\r\n        replicas of designer brands), music and video cassettes, clothing,\r\n        jewelry, and ornaments. The side streets are full of open-air\r\n        restaurants offering dishes of barbecued pork, duck, and seafood,\r\n        noodles, rice-pots, and do-it-yourself ?steamboats. ?\r\n        Past the Jalan Tun H. S. Lee and Jalan Cheng Lock junction\r\n        is the See Yeoh Temple, founded by Yap Ay Koy, a city leader in KL?s\r\n        early days. The largest temple is Chan See Shu Yuen, built in 1906, is\r\n        dedicated to Chong Wah, a Sung dynasty emperor. It also marks\r\n        Chinatown?s southern boundary.\r\n        One of the breathtaking displays of color comes soon after\r\n        the Kwoong Siew Association Temple, in the Sri Mahamariamman Hindu\r\n        Temple on Jalan Bandar, on the west side of Chinatown. It was built in\r\n        the style of a south Indian gopuram (temple gatehouse-tower), covered\r\n        with a riot of colorful statuary from the Hindu pantheon. First erected\r\n        in 1873, it was shunted across to its present site to make way for the\r\n        railway station in 1855, and it is from here the annual Thaipusam\r\n        pilgrimage to the Batu Caves (see page 53) commences.\r\n        North and east of the historic center is KL?s ?Golden\r\n        Triangle,? which is a newer office, entertainment, and shopping\r\n        district. Nearby are two of the tallest landmarks in the city. Visitors\r\n        drawn to the Petronas Twin Towers, located north of this triangle and\r\n        known officially as the Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC), will be\r\n        disappointed to find that there is no public access to the upper\r\n        stories. It is possible to retreat into the shopping mall next door for\r\n        up-market fashions and food. For the best views of the city try the\r\n        Menara Kuala Lumpur???or communications tower???which opened in July\r\n        1996 and rises to 421 m (1,381 ft) on the western edge of the district.\r\n        The non-stop lift takes 55 seconds from ground to the observatory, but\r\n        offers spectacular views of the city and beyond! For those wanting to\r\n        eat on the move, there is the Seri Angkasa revolving restaurant on the\r\n        level above.\r\n        Cultural and Historical Sights\r\n        Located on Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin opposite the KL Railway\r\n        Station???in what was once the Majestic Hotel???is the Balai Senilukis\r\n        (National Art Gallery) of Malaysian and foreign art. West of the\r\n        railway station and within view is the Masjid Negara (National Mosque),\r\n        a vast, modern complex covering over 5 hectares (13 acres). On Fridays\r\n        and other important religious days it can house 8,000 worshippers under\r\n        the tent-like stone roof of its Grand Hall. Walls of openwork stone\r\n        tracery support a canopy of 18 folds fanning out in a circle. These\r\n        symbolize the 13 states of Malaysia and 5 pillars of Islamic faith. The\r\n        mosque also includes ceremonial rooms, a library, a meeting hall, and a\r\n        mausoleum for national heroes, set around cool pools mirroring the blue\r\n        stained-glass of the Grand Hall and marble galleries. Soaring above it\r\n        all is a 73-m (239-ft) high minaret, with a graceful balcony from which\r\n        the muezzin calls the faithful to prayer.\r\n        The Muzium Negara (National Museum) stands on Jalan\r\n        Damansara south of the Lake Gardens. The building, opened in 1963,\r\n        blends modern and traditional Malay design. Two glass mosaic murals\r\n        flanking the entrance depict themes of Malaysia?s culture and history.\r\n        There are five main galleries dedicated to such subjects as history,\r\n        national sports, and na tural history.\r\n        Other museums include the National History Museum on Jalan\r\n        Raja south of the Dataran Merdeka, with exhibits on the country?s\r\n        history dating back 520 million years (metamorphic sandstone) as well\r\n        as a 40,000-year-old homo sapiens skull. The older Royal Malaysian\r\n        Police Museum (1961) on Jalan Semarak highlights the war against the\r\n        communist insurgents from 1948 to 1960, known as ?The Emergency. ? On\r\n        the campus of the University of Malaysia is the Asian Art Museum, with\r\n        exhibits of sculptures and textiles from within the region. Given the\r\n        extent of wealth it has brought to the country, it is not surprising to\r\n        have a Natural Rubber Museum, which opened since 1992 at the Rubber\r\n        Research Institute?s Experimental Station in Sungai Buloh.\r\n        Taman Tasik Perdana (The Lake Gardens)\r\n        West of the Masjid Negara are the Taman Tasik Perdana (Lake\r\n        Gardens). These 911?2 hectares (238 acres) of parkland were landscaped\r\n        in 1888 under British British resident Frank Swettenham for the\r\n        citizens? relaxation. It is a popular place for picnicking, jogging,\r\n        and resting beneath the trees, and it features an artificial lake for\r\n        boating, providing a lovely escape from the city?s tensions. The\r\n        Gardens are also home to a deer park and a vast expanse of netting\r\n        marking the aviary of the bird park, within which are over 5,000 birds.\r\n        Within the bounds of the Gardens is a Planetarium and exhibition as\r\n        well as space theme park.\r\n        Set on a hill at the northern end of the park across a main\r\n        road, the Tugu Negara (National Monument) commemorates Malaysia?s\r\n        recent dark history through the years of the ?Emergency? from 1948 to\r\n        1960. The bronze group sculpture stands in an attractive setting of\r\n        reflecting pools and fountains with a mosque at one end. It was\r\n        designed by Felix de Weldon and bears a striking similarity to his Iwo\r\n        Jima Memorial to the Pacific War in Washington, DC. Triumphant\r\n        flagbearers are flanked by armed guards while another soldier helps a\r\n        wounded comrade. Beneath them sprawl the enemy?s dead. Also on the\r\n        National Monument grounds is a Cenotaph to the British Commonwealth?s\r\n        dead of the two World Wars. West of the Monument, just outside the\r\n        park, is the 18-story Parliament House, which holds the sessions of the\r\n        Senate and House of Representatives.\r\n        Away From the City Center\r\n        To see the tin magnates? mansions that remain standing,\r\n        take a taxi ride on Jalan Ampang some 10 km (6 miles) northwest out of\r\n        town. A few of these grand 19th- and 20th-century residences survive\r\n        tucked away among the skyscrapers, the jungle often invading the\r\n        gardens. They offer insight into the massive wealth amassed by the tin\r\n        magnates during their heyday.\r\n        One of thebest preserved is the Dewan Tunku Abdul Rahman,\r\n        built in 1935 by Chinese tin and rubber mogul Eu Tong Sen. Nowadays it\r\n        is a one-stop center of the Malaysian Tourist Information Complex.\r\n        Most drivers will be able to point out the Bok House,\r\n        transformed into the elegant Coq d?Or Restaurant. It is a beautiful\r\n        structure, retaining its porticoed verandas, 18th- century paintings,\r\n        and Italian marble floors. It was the home of Chu Cheng Bok, a\r\n        legendary rags-to-riches entrepreneur who gave up the old iron of his\r\n        bicycle repair shop for a fortune in tin and other business. His will\r\n        decreed the house never to be sold, ensuring the mansion?s future, even\r\n        as other residences fell into disrepair and demolition, often to be\r\n        replaced by skyscrapers.\r\n        A taxi to the new sports stadium at Bukit Jalil takes you\r\n        to the centerpiece of Malaysia?s site for the 1998 Commonwealth Games.\r\n        The spectacular partially covered stadium has a capacity of 100,000;\r\n        nearby is a 4,000-seat Aquatic Center. The complex adds to the Negara\r\n        (National) and Merdeka stadiums near the city.\r\n        While there are an ever-increasing number of major\r\n        department stalls and malls, night markets remain a favorite throughout\r\n        Malaysia for good deals, excellent local food, and just plain\r\n        entertainment value. The cheapest of the markets is at Chow Kit, where\r\n        Batu Road crosses Jalang Dang. Another market catering to more\r\n        traditional tastes is the Kampung Bahru (new village), behind the Chow\r\n        Kit area. This market is a Pasar Minggu (Sunday Market), but like so\r\n        many other similar markets throughout the country, it begins late\r\n        Saturday afternoon and trades on into the early hours of Sunday\r\n        morning.\r\n        Day Trips from Kuala Lumpur\r\n        Theme Parks\r\n        As prosperity has taken hold in Malaysia, so too has the\r\n        style of entertainment. Just beyond the city now are several theme\r\n        parks built out of the remains of the gorges created from tin mining.\r\n        The Mines Wonderland has been built on what was the world?s largest\r\n        open-cast mining operation. South of Kuala Lumpur along Jalan Sungai\r\n        Besi, it includes snow-making facilities for a winter feel in the\r\n        tropics. Another park is Sunway Lagoon in Bandar Sunway, located near\r\n        the state capital of Selangor, Shah Alam; it is known for its water\r\n        attractions and rides.\r\n        Batu Caves\r\n        The giant Batu Caves are a popular excursion 45 minutes?\r\n        drive north of town just off the Ipoh Road. Set in limestone cliffs\r\n        hidden in the jungle, they were ?discovered? in 1878 by a group of\r\n        explorers, including the American naturalist William Hornaday. The\r\n        caves were a hide-out for anti-Japanese, Communist guerrillas during\r\n        World War II. Now transformed into a Hindu shrine, they receive their\r\n        most attention during the Thaipusam festival celebrated in the early\r\n        months of each year.\r\n        There are in fact dozens of underground limestone vaults\r\n        attracting botanists and zoologists to witness their unique flora and\r\n        fauna, but only three caves are open to the general public. At the top\r\n        of a 272-step staircase is the Cathedral Cave, the most breathtaking of\r\n        the three, with its architectural columns of lofty stalactites and\r\n        stalagmites. At the foot of the hill, a bridge over a pond leads to the\r\n        Art Gallery Cave, with displays of garish statues of Hindu deities, and\r\n        the Poets Cave, where verses of the ancient Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar\r\n        are painted on stone tablets. These two-line kural verses deal\r\n        variously with morals, wisdom, love, and finances.\r\n        Templer Park\r\n        Farther north (another 9 km/6 miles along the Ipoh Road)\r\n        from the Batu Caves is Templer Park, which offers the sights of a\r\n        Malaysian rainforest for those with little time to venture into the\r\n        major national parks and forested areas. Britain?s last High\r\n        Commissioner, Sir Gerald Templer, conceived the park as a ?vast jungle\r\n        retreat for the public? in 1950. Covering an area of 1,200 hectares\r\n        (3,000 acres), the rainforest comes complete with waterfalls, rushing\r\n        streams, lagoons for swimming, and caves in the Bukit Takum limestone\r\n        cliffs to explore. There are several clearly defined paths, with the\r\n        highest point being Bukit Takum 740 m (2,428 ft) on the western side of\r\n        the river in the park?s northern corner. For golf enthusiasts, two\r\n        courses reassure the visitor you are close to civilization.\r\n        The Highlands\r\n        By the time Malaysia came under the British imperial sway,\r\n        colonial officials had fully developed the grand institution of the\r\n        hill station, where they could cool off from the hot and humid lowlands\r\n        in the days before air-conditioning. These havens of relaxation set\r\n        among golf courses, gardens, and orchards still do the mountain ranges\r\n        of the peninsula?s interior, but they are now holiday resorts.\r\n        Nowadays, Malaysian families are lured to the highlands closest to\r\n        Kuala Lumpur???The Genting and Fraser?s Hill???while the Cameron\r\n        Highlands is most popular region for foreign visitors. These retreats\r\n        offer everything from casinos to horseback riding, golf to jungle\r\n        trekking, depending on the location. The jungles, especially in the\r\n        Cameron Highlands, were once the strongholds for rebels during the\r\n        Emergency, so some caution is required when venturing into undeveloped\r\n        areas; good maps are a must, and on occasions a guide would be\r\n        recommended.\r\n        Genting Highlands\r\n        Nearest of the highland resort areas to Kuala Lumpur at 51\r\n        km (30 miles), the Gentings rise to 2,000 m (6,560 ft) and are a far\r\n        cry from the peaceful, misty, forested mountains they were just two\r\n        decades ago. Now, the resort and hotel complex is variously described\r\n        as simply noisy to a ?one-stop destination for fantasy, excitement, and\r\n        adventure?; your conclusion obviously depends on your point of view.\r\n        You?ll find a wide range of facilities here, from an 18-hole golf\r\n        course to a theme park with cinemas, a monorail, boat-rides, and\r\n        restaurants???even a 32-lane ten-pin bowling center. The resort?s\r\n        casino is Malaysia?s only such legal gambling house, with strict dress\r\n        codes requiring men to wear ties or long-sleeved batik shirts.\r\n        Fraser?s Hill\r\n        In contrast to the Genting Highlands, this charming,\r\n        old-fashioned hill station, located 100 km (60 miles) northwest of KL,\r\n        is built across seven hills, its highest point being 1,500 m (4,921 ft)\r\n        in the Titiwangsa mountain range. These days it offers a retreat for\r\n        Malaysia?s business set. The resort was named after Louis James Fraser,\r\n        an English adventurer and scoundrel, who dealt in mule hides, tin,\r\n        opium, and gambling. But Fraser disappeared mysteriously before the\r\n        hill station came into being, in 1910.\r\n        Road access may be difficult, with the last 8 km (5 miles)\r\n        along a winding, narrow roadway where an alternating, one-way traffic\r\n        system is in place. It was along this portion of road, where you?ll now\r\n        see a sign ?Emergency Historical Site,? that British High Commissioner\r\n        Sir Henry Gurney was killed during the height of the Communist\r\n        insurgency in 1951.\r\n        The countryside is wilder and less cultivated than that in\r\n        the Cameron Highlands, but the sedate side of colonial life is also\r\n        more recognizable here in the white-and-grey stone bungalows with\r\n        roses, rhododendrons, poinsettias, hollyhocks, and dahlias in the\r\n        gardens. You?ll find a range of accommodation on offer, from the Jalai\r\n        Hill Resort and Puncak Inn in the top tier to more middle-range inns,\r\n        bungalows, and even a youth hostel. There are good tennis courts, a\r\n        nine-hole golf course, tennis courts, playgrounds, and even horseback\r\n        riding.\r\n        Several nature trails are also marked out through the\r\n        nearby forests, and the wealth of wildlife makes jungle rambles\r\n        particularly enjoyable. A swim is possible at the Jeriau Waterfall,\r\n        41?2 km (2 miles) north of town. Birdwatchers look out for over 270\r\n        species of birds which may be seen in the immediate area. Each June,\r\n        the Malaysian Nature Society supports an ?international bird race,?\r\n        where teams compete to identify the largest number of birds.\r\n        Cameron Highlands\r\n        The finest of the cool hill resorts, 240 km (150 miles)\r\n        from KL, stands on a splendid plateau of rolling green valleys\r\n        surrounded by the rugged granite peaks of the Titiwangsa Range, the\r\n        tallest of which is Mount Brinchang at 2,032 m (6,664 ft). If you?ve\r\n        been traveling on the coast, or elsewhere in semi-tropical Southeast\r\n        Asia, the Cameron Highlands, located over 1,520 m (4,987 ft) above sea\r\n        level, offer great relief amid morning mists and cool breezes.\r\n        Spread over three districts are the townships of Ringlet,\r\n        Tanah Rata? (?the main township), and Brinchang. Ringlet township, the\r\n        first point of arrival, offers little that is special, apart from\r\n        flower nurseries and access to some tea plantations. Thirteen\r\n        kilometers (7 miles) farther brings you to Tanah Rata, the main\r\n        township. On the road from Ringlet is the Sultan Abu Bakar Lake, an\r\n        artificial lake formed by the damming of the Bertam River. Brinchang, a\r\n        few more kilometers beyond Tanah Rata, is better known for its\r\n        vegetable farms, and of course, the famous tea plantations.\r\n        The hill station was named after William Cameron, a British\r\n        surveyor, who in 1885 reported the finding of the ?fine plateau. ? His\r\n        ?discovery? was soon followed by tea planters and Chinese vegetable\r\n        growers. The Highlands also still hold the answer to the mysterious\r\n        disappearance of wealthy American Thai-silk entrepreneur Jim Thompson,\r\n        who disappeared on an evening in 1967 after going off for stroll while\r\n        on holiday at the hill station.\r\n        The Highlands are best reached by train on the\r\n        KL?Butterworth line to Tapah Road station and then by taxi up into the\r\n        hills. Driving yourself on the narrow winding road with frequent\r\n        back-ups imposed by trucks in a hurry could be a hazardous business.\r\n        Let the taxi driver worry about that, while you admire the magnificent\r\n        scenery changing from lowland mangrove, bamboo, and palms, to denser\r\n        rainforest of lush greenery and, as the heat drops away to the more\r\n        comfortable mountain air, montane oaks and laurels familiar to\r\n        temperate climates.\r\n        Tanah Rata is festooned with hotels, good Chinese and\r\n        Indian restaurants, and a variety of English-style tearooms serving the\r\n        local Cameronian brew together with cakes and servings of locally grown\r\n        strawberries and cream. Stores offer everything from the practical to\r\n        glass-mounted scorpions and butterflies.\r\n        A visit to a tea plantation is easily arranged, with bus\r\n        service readily available to and from the farms. The main plantations\r\n        are the Boh Tea Estate and the Sungai Palas and Blue Valley tea\r\n        estates. Accommodation options in Tanah Rata vary depending on your\r\n        budget, with the upper tier offering international-class resorts such\r\n        as Strawberry Park, to the moderately priced Cameronian Holiday Inn.\r\n        Worth a visit???even if you can?t afford the room rates???is Ye Olde\r\n        Smokehouse near the golf course. The ivy-covered, mock-Tudor resort has\r\n        become something of an institution since it was built in the 1930s. An\r\n        afternoon traditional ?cream tea? or English roast lunch or dinner is\r\n        an experience in itself. Nearby is a fine 18-hole public golf course,\r\n        beautifully kept despite the strange hazard of a narrow, concrete-sided\r\n        canal running across the middle of it.\r\n        The cooler climate makes jungle walks here a special\r\n        pleasure, not least of all for the myriad brightly colored butterflies\r\n        around the waterfalls, with almost a dozen officially listed. Several\r\n        of the walks pass through???or close to???the Malaysian Agriculture\r\n        Research Development Institute, just a few kilometers from Tahan\r\n        Rata.\r\n        The two most clearly marked paths from Tanah Rata, easiest\r\n        for the whole family, lead within an hour to a refreshing swim at Parit\r\n        Falls or Robinson Falls. Other, more challenging choices, for which you\r\n        should enlist the help of a guide, take you up to Mount Perdah (1,576\r\n        m/5,169 ft), Mount Jasar (1,696 m/5,562 ft), and Mount Beremban (1,841\r\n        m/6,040 ft). Besides the butterflies, look out for red-bellied\r\n        squirrels, wild pigs, and, if you are lucky, an occasional tapir. The\r\n        local Butterfly Farm is probably your best chance of seeing the grand\r\n        ?Rajah Brooke Birdwing? and other rare species.\r\n        Perak\r\n        A journey to Perak takes the traveler into what once was\r\n        the key region for Malaysia?s economic prosperity, standing as a lure\r\n        to powerful states and interests as well as (mostly Chinese) migrant\r\n        workers. Tin, the basis for the state?s wealth, was once taken from\r\n        diggings that claimed to be the largest such mines in the world. The\r\n        wealth from the mines paid for many of the historical structures\r\n        evident through the state. Perak, which means ?silver? in Malay, is\r\n        Malaysia?s second largest state, reaching from Tanjung Malim in the\r\n        south to the Thai border, covering some 21,000 sq km (13,125 sq miles).\r\n        Its sultan?s family is also the last to be able to trace its ancestry\r\n        to the 16th-century sultans of Melaka.\r\n        The capital Ipoh may be considered the capital of the\r\n        world?s tin industry. It superseded Perak?s other rich mining capital,\r\n        Taiping (formerly known as Larut), in this role in 1937. Ipoh is now\r\n        the second largest city in Malaysia, while Kuala Kangsar is the royal\r\n        capital and has been home to Perak?s sultans since the 15th\r\n        century.\r\n        The journey north from KL either by train or car takes you\r\n        through a captivating landscape of jungle reaching back from the\r\n        coastal plains to climb the blue hills of the Barisan Titiwangsa Range.\r\n        Amid this wild beauty, enhanced by spectacular outcrops of limestone\r\n        rock, are the tell-tale scars of the tin mines of the Kinta Valley.\r\n        Ipoh\r\n        Once the harbo r for all incoming junks and sampans from\r\n        the Straits of Melaka through the Perak River, the city is located on\r\n        the Kinta River 220 km (135 miles) north of KL. The town offers good\r\n        accommodations and amenities, including a range of restaurants with\r\n        Chinese specialties, such as steamed chicken with bean sprouts and\r\n        noodles.\r\n        The echoes of colonialism are clearly evident in the\r\n        Railway Station, whose Moorish architecture is reminiscent of KL?s\r\n        central station and is locally nicknamed ?the Taj Mahal?; nearby is the\r\n        Majestic Station Hotel. The High Court and Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank\r\n        buildings are also excellent examples of Edwardian architecture. Other\r\n        memories of the British presence are in the clock tower, commemorating\r\n        the first British resident of Perak, James Birch, who was assassinated\r\n        in 1875. St. Michael?s School and the Royal Ipoh Club are also\r\n        monuments of the former colonial era.\r\n        Around Jalan Dato? Sagor and the nearby streets are some of\r\n        the best preserved examples of Chinese architecture in Malaysia. For\r\n        insight into the local tin mining industry, visit the excellent\r\n        Geological Museum on Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah. In addition to exhibits\r\n        of Perak?s rich variety of minerals, ores, and fossils are models of\r\n        tin-mining equipment. Other insights into history are to be found at\r\n        the Darul Ridzuan Museum, housed in the former home of wealthy tin\r\n        miner Foo Choong Yit.\r\n        Outside the city, amid vast caves in limestone outcrops,\r\n        are Buddhist temples. In the south the Kek Lok Tong and Sam Poh Tong\r\n        temples are nestled within high limestone caves and cavities near\r\n        Gunung Rapat. The latter dates back to 1890s, while the present fa?ade\r\n        was built in the 1950s, with the temple still home to a group of monks\r\n        and nuns. Six kilometers (4 miles) north of Ipoh is the Perak Tong,\r\n        built in 1926 by a Buddhist priest from China. Here the main attraction\r\n        is a 13-m (41-ft) sitting Buddha amid the eerie darkened cavern;\r\n        altogether there are more than 40 Buddha statues.\r\n        Saved from the plant over-growth in the past two decades,\r\n        12 km (7 miles) from Ipoh is Kellie?s Castle, a mansion whose\r\n        construction was halted when its owner, William Kellie Smith, a rubber\r\n        planter, died while visiting Scotland in the mid-1920s. Farther south,\r\n        in Teluk Intan, is Malaysia?s equivalent of the leaning tower of Pisa.\r\n        The pagoda-like structure, built in 1885, is 251?2 m (84 ft) tall and\r\n        was once used for water storage.\r\n        Kuala Kangsar\r\n        Home to the Sultans of Perak for the past 500 years, Kuala\r\n        Kangsar is built on a sweep of the Perak River (Sungei Perak) 50 km (32\r\n        miles) from Ipoh on a newer highway. The town has two royal palaces;\r\n        the brash stone residence Istana Iskandariah, and the more elegant\r\n        traditional timbered Istana Kenangan, now used as a Royal Museum. This\r\n        is also where Malaysia?s rubber industry started with the planting of\r\n        nine seedlings by former resident Hugh Low in 1877, one of which still\r\n        survives near the district office on Jalan Raja Bendahara. The most\r\n        striking building, up on a grass mound, is the Ubudiah Mosque, with its\r\n        massive onion dome of glowing copper set in a nest of white. Begun in\r\n        1917, its construction was interrupted on several occasions, most\r\n        dramatically when two elephants of the Sultan Idris went on a rampage\r\n        on the imported Italian marble floor.\r\n        Kuala Kangsar has long been famous for Malay College, set\r\n        amid spacious grounds near the center of town, a prestigious and\r\n        exclusive school for the Malay aristocracy since it was founded by the\r\n        British in 1904. It is now open to the best (Malay) scholars of all\r\n        classes.\r\n        Taiping\r\n        Another 30 minutes? drive from Kuala Kangsar, this old\r\n        mining town was formerly known as Larut. Its present-day name, meaning\r\n        ?everlasting peace,? was proposed by Britain as part of its diplomatic\r\n        contribution to the end of the bloody feuds between Chinese secret\r\n        societies fighting over control of the tin-mining industry in the\r\n        1870s. They were forced to end their conflict under the Treaty of\r\n        Pangor in 1874 after British intervention.\r\n        Happily boasting the peninsula?s heaviest rainfalls,\r\n        Taiping, the former capital of Perak state, is now a sleepy town full\r\n        of large treesoverhanging the wide streets. It was able to landscape a\r\n        magnificent park, Lake Gardens, from an tin mine abandoned in 1890,\r\n        then owned by Chung Keng Kwee. The grounds are now home to a 9-hole\r\n        golf course, a small zoo, and an old Government Rest House (now a\r\n        hotel) combining Neo-Classical Doric columns with a slightly curving\r\n        Minangkagau roof???ideal for shedding the heavy rains.\r\n        Built in 1886, the Perak Museum, housing an interesting\r\n        display of ancient weapons and Orang Asli implements, is the oldest in\r\n        Malaysia. On the way, you will pass the prison, used by the Japanese in\r\n        World War II and then for guerrilla troops captured during the\r\n        Emergency. Built in 1885, these days the prison carries out most of the\r\n        executions of Malaysia?s drug offenders.\r\n        Beyond the Lake Gardens, the Taiping War Cemetery bears\r\n        impressive witness to the peninsula?s early role in the Pacific War\r\n        against the Japanese. The tombs of men of the Royal Australian Air\r\n        Force, Indian Army Corps of Clerks, Ambulance Sepoy of the Indian Army\r\n        Medical Corps, and Royal Air Force reveal that many of them died on the\r\n        very first day of active duty: 8 December 1941.\r\n        Once a tea estate, cool, cloud-enshrouded Bukit Larut\r\n        (Maxwell Hill), 12 km (71?2 miles) northeast from Taipin, was\r\n        Malaysia?s smallest and oldest hill station and the retreat for\r\n        colonial administrators. At 1,035 m (3,400 ft) above sea level, it has\r\n        great views when the misty rain-clouds break. Near the jeep terminal,\r\n        pretty bungalows and rest houses offer rooms for rent, with balconies\r\n        overlooking the valley, but booking in advance is necessary. The walk\r\n        to the summit is signposted, and upon reaching the top on a clear day\r\n        it is possible to view the sweep of the coastline from Penang to\r\n        Pangkor.\r\n        Pulau Pangkor\r\n        One of the few locations on the west coast to offer\r\n        palm-fringed beaches is Pulau Pangkor (Pangkor Island). The beaches are\r\n        a regular holiday retreat, offering swimming and other activities as\r\n        well as jungle walks. The ferry from Lumut, about 50 km (31 miles)\r\n        south of Taiping, to Pangkor Island takes about 45 minutes. Once there,\r\n        you?ll find the wide sands of the Pantai Puteri Dewi (Beach of the\r\n        Beautiful Princess) along the 122-hectare (301-acre) island?s northern\r\n        shore. It is part of Pangkor Laut Resort, one of the most exclusive\r\n        destinations in Asia.\r\n        Taman Negara\r\n        This grand national park provides an ideal setting for\r\n        exploring vast expanses of rainforest, fast-flowing rivers, and\r\n        mountains of the peninsula?s Main Range. It covers an area of 4,343 sq\r\n        km (1,676 sq miles), spreading across three states: Pahang, Terengganu,\r\n        and Kelantan.\r\n        Backpackers may want to go it alone, but most are advised\r\n        to plan their visit through a tour operator in KL or before they leave\r\n        for Malaysia. Armed with an entry permit, visitors make first for the\r\n        park headquarters, 300 km (187 miles) northeast of the national capital\r\n        by road via Jerantut and 60 km (37 miles) by motor-powered longboat\r\n        from Kuala Tembeling. (Buy your film, batteries, mineral water,\r\n        insect-repellent, etc. , at Jerantut: everything is more expensive\r\n        inside the park. )\r\n        The boat ride on the Tembeling River is likely to be one\r\n        of the highlights of your visit. Along the way, you will see aboriginal\r\n        Negrito fishermen???the only human residents allowed to stay here by\r\n        park authorities???setting or checking their nets. Keep a look out,\r\n        too, for water buffalo taking a soak, river-lizards slipping in and out\r\n        of the water and looking as large as crocodiles (the latter do not come\r\n        this far upstream), and even an occasional otter. Among the birds, you\r\n        will see the flash of a kingfisher or hornbill. Wear a hat and bring\r\n        along plenty of mineral water. The journey usually takes three hours,\r\n        even longer when short stretches of the river dry up, forcing\r\n        passengers to walk along the riverbank while the boatmen push the\r\n        launch through the shallows.\r\n        The headquarters at Kuala Tahan have a good range of\r\n        accommodation???chalets, a hostel, and a rest house???plus washing\r\n        facilities, restaurants, and a grocery store. Payment is strictly in\r\n        Malaysian currency. (For your trekking requirements, see page 181. )\r\n        The park headquarters organize evening slide-shows as a general\r\n        introduction to the features of the surrounding rainforest.\r\n        Jungle Trails\r\n        There are marked trails leading from the park?s\r\n        headquarters into the jungle. Guides use them for organized walking and\r\n        boat tours, but you can, of course, go off in your own group. There are\r\n        both day trips and overnight tours to observation-hides, from where you\r\n        can watch for wildlife visiting nearby salt-licks and watering holes.\r\n        Overnight stays are organized at several observation-hides in the\r\n        region, namely at Kumbang, Yong, Tabing, Belau, and Cegar Anjing.\r\n        Headquarters will provide sheets if you do not have a sleeping bag. You\r\n        should be in the hide by the afternoon and out again the next morning\r\n        at around 9:30am. From park headquarters, day trips leaving in the\r\n        early morning include: a walk to Bukit Indah, followed by a boat ride\r\n        through the rapids to Kuala Trenggan, returning to headquarters on\r\n        foot; a walk to the Tabing Hide, followed by a boat ride to the Lata\r\n        Berkoh rapids, then another trek back to headquarters; a boat ride on\r\n        the Tembeling River to the Gua Telinga Bat Cave, which you enter on\r\n        hands and knees until you can stand???you then find yourself in a great\r\n        vault inhabited by hundreds of fruit- and insect-eating bats not at all\r\n        interested in attacking humans. Only the squeamish will object to the\r\n        giant toads and harmless little white cave-racer snakes.\r\n        The most adventurous trek for experienced climbers is a\r\n        full nine-day walk up and down the peninsula?s highest peak, Mount\r\n        Tahan (2,187 m/7,173 ft) high. A jungle guide accompanies the\r\n        group.\r\n        Flora and Fauna\r\n        The dipterocarp rainforest here includes the tualang tree.\r\n        At 50 m (164 ft), it is the tallest tree in Southeast Asia. Among the\r\n        jungle fruit are mango, durian, rambutan, and wild banana. At over\r\n        1,500 m (5,000 ft), you will see montane oaks and conifers.\r\n        With patience and luck by day or rotating shift watches by\r\n        night, you may see wild pigs, sambars, and barking deer, gibbons,\r\n        pig-tailed macaques and leaf monkeys, tree shrews, and red flying\r\n        squirrels. Visitors to the Kumbang Hide have seen rare tigers and\r\n        leopards.\r\n        During the fruit season, birdwatchers have spotted up to\r\n        70 species just around the park headquarters. Among them: lesser fish\r\n        eagle, crested serpent eagle, osprey, peacock pheasant, and garnet\r\n        pitta. From September to March you can also see migrant Arctic\r\n        warblers, Japanese paradise flycatchers, and Siberian blue robins.\r\n        Even if you do not spot much of the wildlife we\r\n        mention???and you are almost assured of seeing something???the sheer\r\n        experience of the jungle at night, with its incredible noises, the\r\n        flitting of mysterious fireflies, and the sense of invisible but\r\n        omnipresent life and movement around you make it all worthwhile.\r\n        The West Coast\r\n        For the romantics, the township names of Port Dickson and\r\n        Melaka (formerly Malacca) on the West Coast evoke stories of the\r\n        glorious past of sailing ships and Chinese junks carrying spices,\r\n        silks, and gold, of cutlasses, noble men, and beautiful princesses. In\r\n        many ways this is the story of southwestern Malaysia?s southwest\r\n        coastline. Nowadays, the rich tapestry of history lies in the monuments\r\n        and homes as well as the descendants of the Malay and Indian, the\r\n        Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonizers. In the far north,\r\n        Pulau Penang is both holiday destination and commercial center, while\r\n        closer to the border with Thailand, Pulau Langkawi is the newest resort\r\n        destination for those in search of white sands and gentle seas.\r\n        South from KL to Melaka\r\n        The highway from Kuala Lumpur and Selangor leads through\r\n        Negeri Sembilan, literally the ?nine states? federated as one in the\r\n        18th century. You travel past the vast palm oil and rubber plantations\r\n        to the state capital of Seremban, 64 km (40 miles) southwest of KL.\r\n        Sereban\r\n        Here the architecturally distinctive Minangkabau\r\n        buffalo-horn roofs of Sumatran heritage are evident, together with the\r\n        more recent colonial Victorian style and the traditions of Chinese\r\n        commercial shophouses. The main attractions are the State Legislative\r\n        Assembly Building, a nest of nine roofs, one for each founding state,\r\n        and the Taman Seni Budaya Negeri (Arts and Culture Complex). Visit the\r\n        state museum, and in the grounds opposite is the Kampung Ampang Tinggi,\r\n        built entirely of wood, a Malay prince?s residence. On show in the\r\n        museum are weapons as well as brass and silverware and a tableau\r\n        portraying a grand royal wedding. The Neo-Classical State Library, with\r\n        its imposing colonial fa?ade, was once the State Secretarial Building.\r\n        Opposite is the extensive Lake Gardens.\r\n        Sri Menanti\r\n        For what is probably the best original example of\r\n        Minangkabau architecture, take a side trip to the old royal capital, 37\r\n        km (23 miles) east of Seremban on the Kuala Pilah Road. The ruler?s\r\n        palace, Istana Lama, was the official residence of the royal family\r\n        until 1931, replacing an earlier palace which had burnt down. The\r\n        palace features 99 pillars, denoting 99 warriors of various luak\r\n        (clans).\r\n        Melaka\r\n        Melaka (Malacca), easily reached by air or express bus\r\n        from KL, was Malaysia?s first city, built on the trading empires of\r\n        spices and textiles and a history soaked in the blood of battles as\r\n        rival colonial powers challenged each other to take hold of the port.\r\n        In its glorious 15th-century heyday, it had been the most vital port in\r\n        Southeast Asia, with as many as 2,000 ships docked as the city?s\r\n        sultans expanded their territorial reach from the wealth of trade to as\r\n        far as Pahang and Singapore and even to the east coast of Sumatra.\r\n        Today, even as the high-rise makes its present felt, the colonial past\r\n        remains in the architecture and monuments. The city?s Chinatown and\r\n        especially along Jalan Hang Jebat???once known as Jonker Street???are\r\n        havens for antiques buyers or those who just want to browse along the\r\n        street?s two-story shophouses.\r\n        The Historic Center\r\n        The main buildings of historical or cultural significance\r\n        are all within easy walking distance of the old center, Dutch Square,\r\n        down by the Melaka River.\r\n        The square is situated just off Melaka Bridge. Spanning\r\n        the river, the bridge was once the town?s main strategic link between\r\n        port and city and the site of major battles against the European\r\n        invaders.\r\n        The most prominent building overlooking the square is the\r\n        Dutch Stadthuys (Town Hall), dating from around 1650. It was originally\r\n        the official residence of Dutch governors and their officers. Behind\r\n        the red fa?ade is a structure of masonry hauled from the Portuguese\r\n        citadel. Since 1980 the building has housed the Museum of Ethnography\r\n        and History, tracing the town?s colonial and Malay past.\r\n        The Jam Besar (clock tower) was built in 1886 by the\r\n        family of Chinese merchant, Tang Bee Sweng. In the middle of the square\r\n        is the Queen Victoria Jubilee Fountain, flanked by a mouse-deer\r\n        recalling the legendary little beast that inspired Prince Parameswara\r\n        to make Melaka his capital.\r\n        Christ Church, with its imposing red exterior, was erected\r\n        between 1741 and 1763, in commemoration of the centenary of the Dutch\r\n        occupation. Additions to the church were made by the British in the\r\n        nineteenth century. Each of the long ceiling beams of its interior is\r\n        hewn from one tree. Equally impressive are the original massive,\r\n        hand-made wooden pews.\r\n        The archway and gate of the A Formosa fortress, the\r\n        remains of the 16th-century Portuguese fort next to Stadthuys, is all\r\n        that stands, saved from total destruction by Sir Stamford Raffles, then\r\n        a government secretary in Penang. The date 1670 and coat of arms were\r\n        added to the gateway by the Dutch East India Company. The gate steps\r\n        lead to the remains of St. Paul?s Church, built by a Portuguese sailor,\r\n        Duarte Coelho, in 1521 and origi nally known as the Church of Our Lady\r\n        of the Annunciation. It was later renamed by the Dutch. In front of the\r\n        church tower is a Statue of St. Francis Xavier, its right arm broken\r\n        off during a storm. The Spanish Jesuit missionary visited Melaka\r\n        several times from 1545 until his death in 1553 on Shangchuan Island\r\n        off the coast of Canton. In the church, a stone slab marks his tomb,\r\n        empty since his remains were transported to Goa in India. Granite\r\n        tombstones from the Dutch era stand against the walls. A Dutch and\r\n        British cemetery is to be found farther down the hill.\r\n        Set among its own grounds is the Tugu Pengistiharn\r\n        Kemerdekaan (Proclamation of Independence Memorial), built in 1912. It\r\n        occupies what was once known as the Malacca Club for British colonials\r\n        and local planters. It was on the club?s padang (playing field) that\r\n        future Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman announced in 1956 the success\r\n        of his London negotiations. Nowadays, the Memorial building offers\r\n        films and documents tracing the campaign for independence. Opposite on\r\n        Padang Pahlawan (Bandar Hill) a sound-and-light show is held in the\r\n        evenings, following the tradition of turning history into entertainment\r\n        to draw the crowds.\r\n        Back to the river, one of Melaka?s more recent additions,\r\n        the Maritime Museum, is housed in a model of the Flor De La Mar, a\r\n        Portuguese ship that sank off Malaka laden with bullion and other\r\n        valuables. Exhibits include models of ships that have called at the\r\n        port over its long and glorious history.\r\n        The Istana Kesultanan Melayu (Malay Sultanate Palace)\r\n        stands as a cultural museum amid elegant gardens north of the Porta da\r\n        Santiago. Reconstructed from ancient prints, it is an approximate but\r\n        noteworthy replica of Mansur Shah?s grandiose hilltop residence, which\r\n        is believed to have burned down in 1460.\r\n        Chinatown\r\n        The living history of Melaka is to be found among the Baba\r\n        Nyonya community, the descendants of the original Chinese pioneers and\r\n        entrepreneurs who married local Malay women in the old Straits\r\n        Settlements???Melaka, Penang, and Singapore.\r\n        The narrow streets of Melaka?s Chinatown, just next to the\r\n        river, hold an abundance of history, especially of last century, when\r\n        the entrepreneurs from this community helped lift the local economy.\r\n        Their contribution now stands among the houses along Jalan Tun Tan\r\n        Cheng Lock, also known as ?Millionaire?s Row. ? This is an\r\n        antiques-hunter?s paradise, filled with new and old Oriental\r\n        treasures???porcelain, statues, jewelry, silverware, and heavy\r\n        19th-century furniture. Also, head to Jalan Hang Jebat (formerly Jonker\r\n        Street) for more browsing and bargains.\r\n        One of the mansions, at 50 Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, is\r\n        Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum, an amalgam of three houses belonging to\r\n        the one family. Built in 1896 by rubber planter Chan Cheng Siew, this\r\n        house offers a vivid introduction to the life and culture of the\r\n        Straits Chinese, as the Babas are also known. In a style best described\r\n        as Chinese Palladian, with its Neo-Classical columns and heavy hardwood\r\n        doors, the furnishings and decor bear witness to the great prosperity\r\n        of Baba entrepreneurs. A member of the Chan family usually gives guided\r\n        tours of the house, which last about 45 minutes, and will point out its\r\n        finer points???the silks, filigree, silver ornaments, gleaming\r\n        blackwood furniture inlaid with ivory or mother-of-pearl, and\r\n        monumental gilded teak staircase leading to the bedrooms on the upper\r\n        floor. Also of note: the massive lattice wooden screens though which\r\n        unmarried daughters were allowed to peep at their parents? guests in\r\n        the drawing room.\r\n        Along Jalan Tokong and Jalan Tukang Emas are Chinese and\r\n        Hindu temples and a Muslim mosque. The Cheng Hoon Teng Temple (or\r\n        Merciful Cloud Temple), originally built in 1646 by ?Kapitan China? Lee\r\n        Wei King, a fugitive from China, claims to be the oldest Chinese temple\r\n        in Malaysia. Dedicated to Kuan Yin, it is flamboyantly decorated with\r\n        multicolored birds and flowers of glass and porcelain. The bronze\r\n        statue of Kwan Yin, the Goddess of Mercy, was brought back from India\r\n        in the 19th century. The Kampung Kling Mosque, on Jalan Tokong (1748),\r\n        is built in the three-tiered Sumatran style with a pagoda-like minaret.\r\n        Unless you are Muslim you cannot enter the mosque, although you are\r\n        able to enter the courtyard. The nearby Sri Pogyatha Vinayagar Moorthi\r\n        Temple (1781), dedicated to the elephant god Ganesh or Vinayagar, is\r\n        also one of the oldest in the country; it dates to 1781. On Jalan\r\n        Kampung Pantai is the Mausoleum of Hang Jebat, who was killed unjustly\r\n        in a duel of honor with his friend Hang Tuah.\r\n        Outside the City Center\r\n        Rather than drive around the sights away from the old city\r\n        center, you may prefer to relax and let the trishaw-driver find the\r\n        way???and give you the bonus of his wry comments. Start perhaps with an\r\n        evening ride along the open-air restaurants on Jalan Taman, better\r\n        known as Glutton?s Corner. Until the recent land reclamation for new\r\n        housing developments, these Malay, Chinese, and Tamil Indian eating\r\n        places bordered on the seafront, but the cuisine (the most notable dish\r\n        being the spicy mee hoon noodles) has not changed.\r\n        Bukit China\r\n        Inland, the hillside provides a Chinese cemetery for over\r\n        12,000 graves, mostly horseshoe-shaped tombs. At the top of the hill\r\n        you will see foundations of the 16th-century Portuguese Franciscan\r\n        monastery and get a splendid view over the town to the Melaka Straits.\r\n        The gaudy red, gold, and white Sam Po Kong Temple stands at the foot of\r\n        Bukit China, honoring Cheng Ho, the eunuch admiral who in 1409 opened\r\n        up Melaka to Chinese trade. Nearby is the Perigi Raja (Sultan?s Well)\r\n        dug in the 15th century for Princess Hang Li Po, whom the Emperor of\r\n        China had given as a bride to Mansur Shah. Its pure waters were\r\n        subsequently protected by Dutch fortifications.\r\n        The Portuguese Settlement\r\n        A short drive some 3 km (2 miles) south of the town center\r\n        along Jalan Parameswara takes you to the heart of this little Eurasian\r\n        community, peopled by descendants of the Portuguese colonists. Around\r\n        Jalan d?Albuquerque and Dataran Portugis (Portuguese Square), the\r\n        houses look no different from those in the rest of Melaka, but you may\r\n        hear snatches of Cristao, a 16th-century Portuguese dialect, and\r\n        mothers calling out to ?Afonso,? ?Luis,? or ?Filomena. ? The\r\n        restaurants on and off the square serve good seafood, though over the\r\n        centuries the Portuguese cuisine has taken on a spicy Asian flavor. The\r\n        community worships at the simple, unassuming St. Peter?s Catholic\r\n        Church, where Easter is an especially big event attracting many\r\n        Indians, Chinese, and Malay non-Catholics to the great candlelit\r\n        procession.\r\n        The Coast Roads\r\n        Swimmers should beware of the pollution at the beaches,\r\n        but it is worth taking a ride north along the Jalan Tengkera coast road\r\n        to visit some of the picturesque fishing villages. On the way, take a\r\n        look at the fine three-tiered, Sumatra-style Kling Tengkera Mosque. It\r\n        is the burial place of Sultan Husain of Johor, who negotiated with\r\n        Raffles the British rights to Singapore. You will find good crab and\r\n        shrimp at the fishing village of Pantai Kundor. Farther north, Tanjung\r\n        Bidara, 35 km (20 miles) from Melaka, has a hotel resort and some\r\n        pleasant tree-shade on the beach for picnics.\r\n        Some 8 km (5 miles) south of Melaka, you can take a boat\r\n        at Umbai out to Pulau Besar. The island has good white sandy beaches\r\n        and offers some pleasant walks in the jungle. A resort has recently\r\n        been opened on Pulau Besar.\r\n        Penang\r\n        Located on the northeast coast of Pulau Pinang (Betel Nut\r\n        Island), Georgetown is the draw to Penang state, with rich colonial and\r\n        historic roots amid the clutter of a market and commercial town. (The\r\n        city is often referred to simply as ?Penang. ? ) Its narrow streets and\r\n        busy thoroughfares add to the adventure, with its Chinese history\r\n        reflected in the shophouses and older hotels. Entry points to the\r\n        island are by road and rail, a ferry journey across the Selat Selatan\r\n        from the industrial town of Butterworth, or by way of the 7-km\r\n        (41?2-mile) drive over the Penang Bridge, which provides wonderful\r\n        views of the harbor. Flights, including international arrivals, land at\r\n        the Bayan Lepas International Airport 18 km (11 miles) south from\r\n        Georgetown, where taxis to the city are available.\r\n        Though most of the activity in Penang is in the city, it?s\r\n        also possible to relax at a beach-side resort or to flee the heat on\r\n        the railway link to the top of Penang Hill. You can virtually step back\r\n        into the island?s history amid colonial buildings, Chinese temples, and\r\n        shophouses. Great shopping opportunities and delicious food add to\r\n        Penang?s charms.\r\n        Georgetown\r\n        Under the British, Penang was named Prince of Wales\r\n        Island, and the capital took its name from the son of King George III,\r\n        the future George IV. Nowadays, it is the third largest of Malaysia?s\r\n        cities behind KL and Ipoh, with a population of around one million;\r\n        Georgetown is also the center for the country?s electronics industry.\r\n        It was also a key retreat for the 1970s hippy population, lured\r\n        especially to the beaches of Batu Ferringhi (see below). Nowadays, the\r\n        city is a blend of historic buildings and modern skyscrapers, and the\r\n        contrast is striking. Move from the rich, scented air surrounding the\r\n        many Chinese temples to such modern buildings as the 65-story\r\n        Komtar???or Tun Abdul Razak Complex???a government, shopping, and\r\n        entertainment center.\r\n        The Old Center. One of the joys of touring Georgetown?s\r\n        historic section is the opportunity to cover many of the sites in this\r\n        compact area by foot. And the best place to begin your tour is at the\r\n        main ferry terminal at Weld Quay. There along the foreshore is the\r\n        Kampung Ayer, or Chinese Water Village, better known as the Clan Piers,\r\n        a hamlet of houses on stilts, joined by wooden walkways over the water\r\n        and inhibited by 2,000 boatmen or fishing families, each group\r\n        belonging to a different clan.\r\n        At the other end of Pengkalan Weld, opposite the Tourist\r\n        Office, is the Jam Besar (Penang Clock Tower) built to mark Queen\r\n        Victoria?s Diamond Jubilee, and presented to the town in 1897. The\r\n        tower is just over 18 m (60 ft) high, one for each year of Victoria?s\r\n        rule at the time of her Jubilee.\r\n        Across the road is Fort Cornwallis (named after Charles\r\n        Cornwallis, Governor General of India), which marks the spot where\r\n        Captain Light arrived on 17 July 1786. The greenery of the park and\r\n        gardens surrounds the fortifications, which were originally made of\r\n        wood and rebuilt in 1810. The cannon on the ramparts were never fired\r\n        in defense of the harbor and these days are put to better use as slides\r\n        for the children?s playground. The oldest cannon is the Seri Rambai;\r\n        originally given to the Sultan of Jahor by the Dutch, it was\r\n        transported to Penang in the 17th century aboard a British steamer of\r\n        the same name. If you see flowers in this barrel, this is likely to be\r\n        an offering from a childless woman hoping for fertility, which the\r\n        cannon is said to be able to bestow.\r\n        Jin Tun Syed Sheh Barakban (also known as the Esplanade)\r\n        runs between the waterfront and the Padang before the fort. This area\r\n        is lined with handsome, 19th-century colonial government buildings,\r\n        their brilliant white evocative of the era one hundred years ago. The\r\n        Britons worshipped in St. George?s Church (1818) on Lebuh Farquhar. It\r\n        is oldest Anglican church in Southeast Asia. In the nearby cemetery,\r\n        set among frangipani trees, is the Grave of Francis Light, who died\r\n        from malaria in 1794, only six years after the start of his Penang\r\n        adventure. And there are many other graves, their tombstones revealing\r\n        the hardships of the town?s history.\r\n        Francis Light?s statue stands at the entrance of the\r\n        Penang Museum and Art Gallery at the corner of Lebuh Light and Lebuh\r\n        Farquhar. In fact, as no photograph of Light himself was available, the\r\n        sculpture is a likeness made from a portrait of his son, William (who\r\n        founded the city of Adelaide in Australia). The museum is housed in\r\n        what was the Penang Free School. Founded in 1816, it was the first\r\n        English language school in Southeast Asia. There is a fine collection\r\n        of historical memorabilia as well as old paintings and etchings, and a\r\n        19th-century Chinese bridal chamber. Also on show is one incongruous\r\n        exhibit left by the Royal Air Airforce: a bronze bust of the German\r\n        Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Art Gallery, upstairs, has a display of batik\r\n        paintings, oils, graphics, and Chinese ink drawings.\r\n        One of the great monuments from Georgetown?s colonial days\r\n        is the Eastern & Oriental Hotel at 10?12 Lubuh Farquhar. Even if\r\n        you are not staying at one of the E & O?s grand old rooms???where\r\n        such authors as Kipling and Somerset Maugham once stayed???do at least\r\n        take a drink in the venerable 1885 Bar commemorating the year of the\r\n        hotel?s founding. The E & O is actually a fusion of two separate\r\n        hotels: the Eastern, facing the Esplanade, and the Oriental, facing the\r\n        sea. It was the brainchild of Martin and Tigran Sharkie, Armenian\r\n        brothers who also created the famous Raffles Hotel in Singapore.\r\n        Recently restored to its former splendor, is now linked to a select\r\n        group of famous hotels in Southeast Asia and Indo-china. In the\r\n        evening, sit by the pool overlooking the wide waters and dream of\r\n        supping in the days of the Empire.\r\n        Chinatown. The heartland of Georgetown?s chinatown is\r\n        centered on Lebah Chulia and Lebah Campbell, both of which run off the\r\n        city?s main commercial thoroughfare of Jalan Penang. Here amid a sea of\r\n        two-story shophouses and busy lanes, wares spill out, competing for\r\n        space and the attention of shoppers. It is also an area favored by\r\n        backpackers lured by cheap hotels and restaurants and the chance of\r\n        purchasing discounted air tickets. The famous flea market is now\r\n        located at Loring Kulit (literally ?Skin Lane?), near the city?s\r\n        stadium. Here you can wade through mountains of old clothes, jewelry,\r\n        utensils, clocks, dolls, ornaments, old coins, and all the bric-a-brac\r\n        of an oriental bazaar. You will find good leather and canvas-wear for\r\n        jungle treks on Campbell and Chulia streets. Here also are the betting\r\n        shops, antique barber shops, and stores offering exotic medicines.\r\n        Wander around the neighborhood?s back streets to admire\r\n        the beautifully kept residential houses, many with elegantly carved\r\n        teak window screens and doorways and handsome gold-and-black lacquered\r\n        name plates. The more flamboyant are the Clan Houses, bulwarks of\r\n        community solidarity. They combine temples for ancestral worship with\r\n        meeting halls to settle local problems???housing, jobs, medical care,\r\n        help for orphans, and discreetly handled intra-community crime.\r\n        Off Lebuh Cannon???so called because of the holes made in\r\n        the road surface here by cannonballs fired during the Great Penang Riot\r\n        of 1867???and through a laneway is the Khoo Kongsi (clan house house of\r\n        the family Khoo). Approach it via a narrow alley near the intersection\r\n        of Jalan Acheh and Lebuh Pitt. Inside is an image of the clan?s patron,\r\n        Tua Sai Yeah, a renowned general of the Ch?in dynasty (221?207 b.c. ).\r\n        Other houses nearby date back to the mid-19th century. The ornate\r\n        ancestral temple Leong San Tong stands opposite a smaller hall used for\r\n        open-air Chinese opera and theater. To the left is the shrine to the\r\n        God of Prosperity and to the right is the hall of sinchoo\r\n        (soul-tablets): gold plaques honoring clan dignitaries and simpler\r\n        wooden panels for more humble clan members.\r\n        The Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, on Lebuh Leith, with its\r\n        striking outer walls of a rich blue color, was built around 1860 by\r\n        Thio Thaw Siat, a Chinese businessman. It is considered one of the best\r\n        examples of 19th-century Chinese architecture in Penang. The building\r\n        is being restored, but its future purpose remains undecided.\r\n        The busiest public temple in Penang is the Kuan Yin Ten\r\n        Temple, on Lebuh Pitt (Jalan Masjid Kapitan Kling), near St. George?s\r\n        Church. It is dedicated to the Goddess of Mercy, who is often\r\n        associated with fertility rituals and other benevolent powers and as a\r\n        result draws a wide range of both the rich and poor to pay respect. For\r\n        newlyweds, the Goddess is also identified with the Indian Boddhisattva\r\n        of Fertility. The shrine is protected by two stone lions at the\r\n        entrance and guardian dragons on the roof. The atmosphere is heavy with\r\n        the scent of burning joss-sticks mixed with aroma of flowers, scented\r\n        oils, fruits, cakes, and roast chicken offered on the altars to help\r\n        solve family problems. This deity forms a bridge between traditional\r\n        Chinese beliefs and Buddhism.\r\n        On the same street is the Kapitan Kling Mosque, the\r\n        state?s oldest mosque, built in 1800 for Muslim Indian soldiers. The\r\n        Sri Mariamman Temple on Lebuh Queen (which runs parallel to Lebuh Pitt)\r\n        was built in 1883 and is the oldest Hindu temple in Penang. Vividly\r\n        decorated, it is dedicated to Lord Subramaniam, the son of Shiva and\r\n        destroyer of evil, who is the focus of worship during the Thaipusam\r\n        festival held in the early months of the year.\r\n        Beyond the City Center\r\n        Away from the frenzy of downtown Georgetown, the main\r\n        sights of interest are Penang Hill and the Botanical Gardens. The drive\r\n        out along Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah takes you past the rubber magnates?\r\n        Neo-Gothic and Palladian mansions, built during the boom that lasted\r\n        through World War I.\r\n        The Buddhist Wat Chayamangkalaram monastery, on Lorong\r\n        Burma, is famous for its 33-m- (108-ft-) long reclining Buddha. The\r\n        site for the temple was given to the community by Queen Victoria in\r\n        1845. The gigantic naga serpents, mystical creatures linking earth to\r\n        heaven, are the balustrades at the entrance of the meditation hall.\r\n        Farther west, away from the temple, you?ll find the\r\n        Botanical Gardens. The 30-hectare (74-acre) garden was created in 1844\r\n        as a tribute to Charles Curtis, its superintendent, who collected\r\n        botanical specimens from the nearby hills. Leaf monkeys and long-tailed\r\n        macaques are among the wildlife. One is cautioned about eating food\r\n        openly, as the monkeys are likely to view this as an invitation to\r\n        dine.\r\n        Jalan Dato Keramat, then Jalan Ayer Hitam, lead west of\r\n        town to the Penang Hill, 830 m (2,722 ft) above sea level, which served\r\n        as a colonial hill station at the turn of the century, and is now\r\n        popular as a weekend excursion for locals. Take a delightfully slow\r\n        ride on the funicular railway (built in 1923) past bungalows and villas\r\n        set amid handsome gardens for panoramic views of the island.\r\n        Day-trippers walk along trails through dense groves of bamboo to catch\r\n        views of flora and wildlife. Birdwatchers look out for blue-tailed\r\n        bee-eaters, sunbirds, and spider-hunters.\r\n        Above the small town of Ayer (also ?Air?) Hitam stands the\r\n        Kek Lok Si (?Temple of Paradise?). It was founded by Abbot Beow Lean, a\r\n        Chinese Buddhist priest from Fujian province in China who arrived in\r\n        Penang in 1887. The temple?s construction began in 1890 and took 20\r\n        years to complete. The centerpiece is the seven-tiered Pagoda of a\r\n        Million Buddhas, which is 30 m (90 ft) high and dedicated to Tsi Tsuang\r\n        Wang. The pagoda is actually a blend of three architectural styles, a\r\n        Chinese octagonal base, a Thai central core, and a Burmese peak. At the\r\n        Tortoise Pond, visitors feed the creatures special vegetables and\r\n        ?tortoise biscuits. ? Boulders on the grounds are covered with Chinese\r\n        calligraphy of Buddhist and Confucian texts. Inside the shrine are\r\n        statues of the Laughing Buddha, radiating happiness; Sakyamuni Buddha,\r\n        incarnation of the faith?s founder; and Kuan Yin, Goddess of Mercy.\r\n        Around The Island\r\n        Away from Georgetown?s hectic, bustling streets and midday\r\n        heat, there is the chance to explore the remainder of the island. A\r\n        tour around the island???about 74 km (46 miles)???will give you the\r\n        best chance to meet the Malay population, who live largely in the rural\r\n        kampungs and fishing villages. The island is a blend of hilly\r\n        rainforest and occasional plantations of rubber, oil palms, pepper,\r\n        nutmeg, cloves, and other spices. A tour around the island can be\r\n        accomplished in just a day, although overnight accommodation away from\r\n        the beach resorts is limited.\r\n        Also northwest 15 km (91?2 miles) from Georgetown are the\r\n        beach resorts of Batu Ferringhi, or simply ?Foreigner?s Rock,?\r\n        including the sandy beaches and rows of luxury hotels offering\r\n        waterskiing, sailing, windsurfing, water scooters, horseback riding,\r\n        and other sports. (There are also small inns and motels in the region\r\n        for travelers on a budget. ) While the beaches are sandy, they may\r\n        prove disappointing to those who have travelled on Malaysia?s\r\n        northeastern coastline.\r\n        On a journey around the island, there are several\r\n        potential stopovers such as Batu Maung, which offers scenic views and a\r\n        seafood restaurant on stilts over the water. Both Sungei Pinang and\r\n        Pantai Aceh are small Chinese villages reached by turning west off the\r\n        main road. For fishing and snorkeling, stop at Teluk Bahang and hire a\r\n        boat out to Muka Head on the island?s northwest tip.\r\n        If a watery adventure is not what you seek, you can trek\r\n        through the Pantai Acheh Forest Reserve. The reserve covers some 20 sq\r\n        km (8 sq miles) of the northwest corner of the island. With only\r\n        camping available as accommodation and vehicles denied access to the\r\n        park, the reward comes in sighting wildlife like wild pigs,\r\n        leopard-cats, slow loris, flying lemurs, leaf monkeys, macaques, and\r\n        black squirrels. The landscape is dotted with granite outcrops.\r\n        Near Teluk Bahang?s town centre is Penang Cultural Centre,\r\n        which features art and crafts and music and dance, as well as\r\n        traditional architecture from elsewhere in Malaysia. At the southern\r\n        end of Teluk Bahang village is the Penang Butterfly Farm, which boasts\r\n        hundreds of different specimens fluttering around a netted enclosure of\r\n        landscaped gardens.\r\n        A tropical fruit farm, just 8 km (5 miles) from Teluk\r\n        Bahang, is unique in that it has cultivated 140 types of exotic fruit\r\n        trees on its 10 hectares (25 acres) since its opening in 1992.\r\n        Birdwatchers gather around Genting, one of the world?s largest nesting\r\n        grounds for bee-eaters of all varieties???blue tailed, blue-throated,\r\n        chestnut-headed, and others gather here in their hundreds.\r\n        As the road turns north again past the airport at Bayan\r\n        Lepas, watch out for signs to the Snake Temple or, more correctly, the\r\n        Temple of the Azure Cloud. Fifteen kilometers (71?2 miles) south from\r\n        Georgetown, it was built in 1850 as a dedication to a Chinese monk,\r\n        Chor Soo Kong, who gained fame in his ability to heal. After the temple\r\n        was invaded by Wagler?s vipers, it was decided they were incarnations\r\n        of the monk and they were accorded sacred status. Although poisonous,\r\n        they are supposedly doped harmless by the incense smoke. A few are said\r\n        to have had their teeth pulled, and the monks will be happy to drape\r\n        them around the shoulders of a photograph-seeking tourist. Smile,\r\n        anyone?\r\n        North to Langkawi\r\n        Part of an archipelago of some 100 islets, the pretty\r\n        resort island of Langkawi lies just south of the sea border to Thailand\r\n        and is increasingly seen as a regional resort option with its myriad\r\n        resort hotels and motels. If you are traveling there by road (rather\r\n        than taking a flight from KL), ferries leave from Kuala Perlis and\r\n        Kuala Kedah. There are overnight ferries from Penang and a twice-weekly\r\n        ferry to and from Thailand?s Phuket Island. There are also\r\n        international flights to Langkawi from Singapore and Kansai Airport in\r\n        Japan.\r\n        The Kedah?Perlis Coast Road\r\n        From Butterworth, the road stretching north into Kedah\r\n        State, heads into the rice bowl of Malaysia, as seas of green spread\r\n        out from either side of the highway as it passes by the Bujang\r\n        Valley.\r\n        At Lembah Bujang is an archeological site that may date\r\n        back to a fifth-century Hindu Kingdom called Langkasuka. The Indian\r\n        traders may have used the city as a entrepot with China. Buddhist\r\n        temples in the Bujang basin have also been uncovered.\r\n        Archeologists are still uncovering remains on the southern\r\n        slopes of Gunung Jerai (Kedah Peak). At 1,200 m (3,936 ft), this is the\r\n        highest peak in Kedah. The Sungei Teroi Forest Recreation Park is to be\r\n        found halfway up the mountain.\r\n        Via the towns of Sungai Petani and Bedong, a left turn\r\n        takes you to Merbok to visit the Candi Bukit Batu Pahat (Temple of\r\n        Chiselled Stone Hill). This is one of the tenth-century temples now\r\n        reconstructed on the Lembah Bajang and possibly built by\r\n        representatives of the South Indian Pallava dynasty before the seventh\r\n        century b.c. More artifacts, ceramics, lingams (phallic symbols), stone\r\n        caskets, and gold and silver Shiva symbols are on show at Merbok?s\r\n        Archaeological Museum.\r\n        Extending beyond Gunung Jerai lie rolling rice fields, fed\r\n        by the Muda River irrigation system, stretching up to Perlis in the\r\n        north and along the coastline from Penang to Langkawi. The Kedah State\r\n        capital, Alor Setar, is the last stop before the Thai border, and its\r\n        history is a sad catalogue of invasion and subjugation, mostly by the\r\n        Thais. In the center of the city is the traditional padang (square),\r\n        here dominated by a fountain and crown of Kedah monument. The Masjid\r\n        Zahir, built in 1912, is located on the square?s western side, its\r\n        Moorish architecture highlighted at night by myriad small lights.\r\n        Standing majestically nearby is the Balai Besar, built in 1898 in the\r\n        Thai style for the royal audiences. Opposite the Masjid Zahir is the\r\n        impressive octagonal Balai Nobat, a tower where the royal nobat drums,\r\n        flutes, and gongs are stored. Nobat, the royal orchestra, is played\r\n        during royal ceremonies; however, it is not open to the public. The\r\n        State Museum, about 15 minutes by car just north of the city, was built\r\n        in 1736, and is worth a visit for its collection of Bunga Mas and Bunga\r\n        Perak (flowers made of real gold and silver), which were sent to the\r\n        Thai court as tribute.\r\n        At the nearby port of Kuala Kedah, also a departure point\r\n        for ferries to Langkawi, you can see the remains of an 18th-century\r\n        fort and sample some of the best seafood in northern Malaysia,\r\n        especially crab.\r\n        Malaysia?s smallest state, Perlis, also marks a change of\r\n        scenery, from the flat rice lands to solitary limestone outcrops, which\r\n        are viewed as guardians to subterranean caves. The main towns are Arau,\r\n        the royal town, and Padang Besar, where the Malaysian and Thai rail\r\n        systems meet. Kuala Perlis, south of the state capital, Kangar, is the\r\n        departure point for the less than an hour?s ferry journey to Langkawi.\r\n        It is also a good location to buy inexpensive fruit at the local\r\n        market.\r\n        Pulau Langkawi\r\n        The Langkawi island group, a cluster of over 100 islands,\r\n        some of which disappear under the high tide, have been a focal point in\r\n        Malaysia?s tourism promotion. But tourism in the area is centered on\r\n        Pulau Langkawi and its array of some 56 holiday resorts and hotels. For\r\n        the ferry traveler, Kuah is your arrival point, while those coming by\r\n        air will touch down at the international airport, located 18 km (11\r\n        miles) northwest from the town. Kuah has some good Chinese, Thai,\r\n        Indian, and Malay restaurants and shops selling a range of goods at\r\n        duty-free rates. Kuah?s town square is dominated by a sculpture of a\r\n        giant eagle (Langkawi means red eagle in Malay). Next to the square is\r\n        a theme park with twenty hectares of landscaped gardens.\r\n        To discover Langkawi?s 80 km (50 miles) of roads, it?s\r\n        possible to rent four-wheel-drive and standard cars, but many find\r\n        bicycles and motorcycles the most attractive way to explore the island\r\n        and reach the more secluded beaches. Swimmers should be careful of\r\n        powerful currents at most of the beaches.\r\n        Most accommodation is located near Kuah town or within\r\n        easy reach of the international airport. The main resorts near Kuah\r\n        include the Sheraton Perdana, Langkawi Seaview Hotel, and The Gates\r\n        Langkawi, while those closer to the airport, on the island?s\r\n        southwestern tip, include the Langkawi Village Resort, Langkawi Holiday\r\n        Villa, Lanai Langkawi, and the Awana Porto Malai. But there are plenty\r\n        of beach chalets and huts located at the beaches around the island.\r\n        Development at Pantai Cenang is among the most extensive\r\n        on the island. An aquarium here, Underwater World, is reputed to be one\r\n        of the largest in Asia, with over 5,000 marine and freshwater fish.\r\n        Tasik Dayang Bunting (Lake of the Pregnant Maiden), the largest\r\n        freshwater lake in all the islands of Langkawi, is accompanied by the\r\n        fable of a Kedah princess who drank the lake?s water and became\r\n        pregnant.\r\n        On the northern cape of Pulau Langkawi is Tanjung Rhu\r\n        (Casuarina Bay). From here a boat journey is the only way to reach the\r\n        Gua Cerita (Cave of Legends), inscribed with writings from the\r\n        Koran.\r\n        Other beaches to visit include Pantai Kok, Pantai Tengah,\r\n        Datai, and Burau Bay. Historical romantics may be interested to know\r\n        that the islands were a favored hideaway for the many pirates who\r\n        preyed on ships in the Melaka Straits. The absence of a detailed,\r\n        legitimate history of the island has led some to cultivate its\r\n        mythology. One such fable surrounds the death of Makam Mahsuri.\r\n        Mahsuri?s Tomb, 12 km (7 miles) west of Kuah, consists of a white\r\n        marble monument set amidst a picturesque garden. The shrine pays\r\n        tribute to a woman wrongly executed for adultery more than 200 years\r\n        ago. As the legend has it, she bled white blood, a testament to her\r\n        innocence, and in her dying words cursed the island for seven\r\n        generations.\r\n        As a change of pace, beach-goers might be interested in a\r\n        jungle trek across the middle of the island. Guided tours can be\r\n        arranged for the hilly Gunnung Raya and Machinchang Forest Reserves,\r\n        where a wide array of wildlife can be viewed; birdwatchers will also be\r\n        rewarded on these treks. One of the easier walks takes you over to the\r\n        Durian Perangin Waterfall.\r\n        At the Pulau Singa Besar Wildlife Sanctuary, 45 minutes\r\n        south of Kuah by boat, you?ll find 640 hectares (1,581 acres) filled\r\n        with monkeys, mouse-deer, iguanas, and peacocks.\r\n        Other sites include a Craft Cultural Complex on the\r\n        northern coast of Langkawi near Teluk Yu, and near the airport, Kampung\r\n        Buku Malaysia, is said to have the only village book market in\r\n        Southeast Asia.\r\n        The East Coast and Johor\r\n        Malaysia?s less-visited east coast offers the visitor a\r\n        slower pace set against the beauty of the region?s beaches and the\r\n        richness of its forests. The region covers four states???Kelantan,\r\n        Terengganu, Pahang, and Johor???with most road traffic plying the coast\r\n        road between Kota Bahru, just 30 km (19 miles) from the Thai border, to\r\n        Johor Bahru, just a causeway?s distance from Singapore. Historically\r\n        resistant to many of the major changes in the rest of Malaysia, the\r\n        region has been able to maintain is authentic Malay culture and Islamic\r\n        traditions. Traditional handicrafts, including the making of spinning\r\n        tops, kites, silverware, baskets, and batik, not to mention\r\n        shadow-puppet shows, are still practiced in many of the rural kampung\r\n        in the states of Kelantan and Terengganu.\r\n        The east coast?s beaches are less developed and offer\r\n        opportunities for snorkeling and diving. Wildlife enthusiasts can enter\r\n        the region?s forests for jungle trekking and adventure travel. The\r\n        region also offers the chance to see leatherback turtles coming to lay\r\n        their eggs at Cherating near Kuantan or to view the craftsmen at Kuala\r\n        Terengganu, whose boating abilities are legendary.\r\n        Economic growth and prosperity???recently through the\r\n        discovery of oil offshore from Terennganu???has meant more hotels, with\r\n        many new properties opening even in the past year; the positive side to\r\n        this is a wider range of accommodation choices at competitive\r\n        rates.\r\n        Kelantan\r\n        White sandy beaches stretch north from the state capital,\r\n        Kota Bharu, to the Thai border. Buddhist temples close to the capital\r\n        hark back to recent centuries, when Kelantan came under the influence\r\n        of Siamese Kings. The British colonial influence here, which came into\r\n        being in a 1909 agreement with Siam, was to last but a brief three\r\n        decades before their defeat by the Japanese in World War II. Kelantan?s\r\n        isolation, as well as its embrace of Islam since the 17th century, kept\r\n        19th-century British colonial influence and economic change at bay and\r\n        enabled this cradle of Malay culture to remain intact.\r\n        Here you?ll see soaring decorative kites as well as the\r\n        wayang kulit (shadow puppet shows), a throwback to wh en Kelantan was\r\n        influenced by the kingdom of Funan in Indochina some 2,000 years\r\n        ago.\r\n        Known as ?Land of Lightning????due the heavy storms during\r\n        the wet season November to February???Kelantan?s gateway is Kota Bharu,\r\n        just 40 minutes by air from Kuala Lumpur and only 30 km (19 miles) from\r\n        the Thai border. To the south, as towns dot the main highway, are\r\n        points of access to the many beaches and fishing villages, themselves\r\n        at the heart of region?s economy and culture.\r\n        Kota Bharu\r\n        Set upon the banks of the Kelantan River, Kota Bahru?s key\r\n        attractions are close to the Pasar Besar (central market) on Jalan\r\n        Doktor. Here rows of food and farm produce almost appear as art itself,\r\n        with vegetables, fruit, and meat on the ground level and kitchenware,\r\n        baskets, and other goods on the floors above.\r\n        The Buluh Kubu Bazaar is also good for bargain-hunters\r\n        seeking T-shirts or silverware. Silversmiths are also to be found on\r\n        Jalan Sultanah Zainab, while batik and other cottage-industry goods are\r\n        over the Jalan Wakat Mek Zainab bridge. The night market, near Pasar\r\n        Besar, will prove worthwhile evening entertainment and give you a\r\n        chance to savor Kelantanese food.\r\n        At sundown, riverside restaurants also come to life near\r\n        to Padang Merdeka (Independence Square), now an open park area for\r\n        recreation but once the town?s fresh market. Merdeka Square was also\r\n        the site where the body of slain Malay warrior Tok Janggut (Father Long\r\n        Beard), who led a rebellion against the British in the early years of\r\n        the century, was exhibited in 1915. The declaration of Independence on\r\n        31 August 1957 was read here as well.\r\n        Across the square is the Bank Kerapu (War Museum), housed\r\n        in the building once used by the Japanese Army as their headquarters;\r\n        it?s the oldest brick building in town (1912). Next door is the Muzium\r\n        Islam, and the Masjid Negiri (State Mosque) beyond, with its ornate\r\n        1926 architecture.\r\n        The Istana Jahar (Royal Customs Museum) was built in 1887,\r\n        with additions by Sultan Muhammad IV in the early years of the 20th\r\n        century. The Istana Balai Besar (Palace with the Large Audience Hall)\r\n        was built in 1844 under Sultan Mohammad II and is now only opened for\r\n        ceremonial occasions (closed to the public). Inside is a throne room,\r\n        royal furniture, and a royal barge, used only once in 1900.\r\n        On the other side of town, along Jalan Sultan Ibrahim and\r\n        near the Tourist Information Centre, is the Kelantan State Museum, with\r\n        its rural Malay artwork and earthenware pots. The best view of living\r\n        Malaysian culture is to be seen at the Gelanggan Seni (Culture Center)\r\n        on Jalan Mahmood opposite the Perdana Hotel, with performances that\r\n        include wayang kulit, main gasing (top spinning), and silat (self\r\n        defense), except on Fridays and during Ramadan.\r\n        Around Kota Bharu\r\n        Within just a few kilometers of Kota Bharu, you can find\r\n        master silversmiths and expert batik weavers, but the maze of country\r\n        lanes around the town could make it difficult to find the kampung\r\n        communities where the artisans still ply their traditional skills. A\r\n        guide may be recommended, with the assistance of the Tourist\r\n        Information Centre.\r\n        Kelatan?s silversmiths use two techniques, the ?filigree?\r\n        and ?repousse,? and items range from the purely ornamental to the\r\n        functional. Silvercraft factories can be visited at Kampung Sireh,\r\n        along Jalan Sultanah Zainab, or Kampung Marak (also called Kampung\r\n        Badang), on the road to Pantai Cahaya Bulan (PCB). Also on the way to\r\n        Pantai Cahaya Bulan, you can see the skill and beauty of kain songket,\r\n        richly woven materials of gold and silver thread, at Kampung Penambang.\r\n        Songket was the product of the region?s early trade with China (with\r\n        silk) and India (with gold and silver thread). Indigenous to Kelantan,\r\n        batik weavers are found throughout the state, but the bigger factories\r\n        are to be found at Kampung Puteh, Kubur Kuda, and Kampung Badang.\r\n        Kite-makers also practice their age-old skills throughout\r\n        the region, and while tradition would have the art passed from father\r\n        to son, many fear the younger generation now lacks the patience to\r\n        carry out the skilled handiwork required.\r\n        One of the oldest mosques in Malaysia is to be found at\r\n        Nilam Puri. The mosque had been dismantled from its site closer to the\r\n        river after repeated flooding at its original location at Kampung Laut.\r\n        The mosque was built entirely without the use of nails.\r\n        Kelantan?s ancient links with Thailand are evident in the\r\n        number of Thai Buddhist Temples you will see half-hidden among the\r\n        groves of palm and laurel, rising above the rice paddies. North of the\r\n        estuary of the Kelantan River near Tumpat (12 km/7 miles from town) is\r\n        one of the most important, Wat Phothivihan, noted for its 40-m (125-ft)\r\n        reclining Buddha. At Kampung Perasit, south of Kota Bharu, is Wat\r\n        Putharamaram.\r\n        One of the landmarks of World War II can be visited at\r\n        Sabak Beach, 13 km (8 miles) northwest of the Khota Bharu, near the\r\n        mouth of the Kelamantan River. Here is the site of the first Japanese\r\n        assault in the Pacific War, over an hour before Pearl Harbor was bombed\r\n        (see page 28). Jutting out of the sandy beach in the pleasant shade of\r\n        palm and casuarina trees stands a crumbling World War II bunker that\r\n        the Indian artillery defended to the last man.\r\n        The Beaches\r\n        Kelantan?s white sandy beaches are within easy access of\r\n        Kota Bharu and provide plenty of opportunities for a pleasant swim.\r\n        Most popular is Pantai Cahaya Bulan, or Moonlight Beach. It was\r\n        previously known as Pantai Cinta Berahi, ?The Beach of Passionate\r\n        Love,? a somewhat incongruous name in this strict Muslim region where\r\n        khalwat, or close proximity, is prohibited. It is just 10 km (6 miles)\r\n        north of the town and is popular during weekends and school holidays.\r\n        More secluded, Pantai Kuda (?Horse Beach?) lies 25 km (15 miles)\r\n        farther north. Pantai Seri Tujuh (?Beach of the Seven Lagoons?), about\r\n        7 km (41?2 miles) from Kota Bharu, is the venue of the International\r\n        Kite Festival and lies on the border with Thailand.\r\n        To the south, Pantai Irama (?Melody Beach?) is some 25 km\r\n        (16 miles) from Kota Bharu; it is one of the most beautiful along the\r\n        entire coast. On the journey to Terengganu???stop off at the fishing\r\n        village of Semerak, 19 km (12 miles) from Pasir Puteh, where you can\r\n        buy excellent seafood for a barbecue on the beach???is Pantai Bisikan\r\n        Bayu (?Beach of the Whispering Breeze,? also known as Pantai Dalam\r\n        Rhu).\r\n        Terengganu\r\n        A coast of sandy beaches along the 225 km (141 miles) of\r\n        landfall facing the South China Sea, not to mention myriad offshore\r\n        islands and hinterland forests near Tasik (Lake) Kenyir, are the draw\r\n        to Terengganu. The wealth from offshore oil discoveries in recent years\r\n        has buoyed the state, something you?ll see reflected in the skyline and\r\n        busy traffic of the capital, Kuala Terengganu. So far the economic\r\n        gains have failed to detract from the town?s relaxed charm. The main\r\n        options for traveling to Terengganu are direct flights from KL or\r\n        interstate bus to the Kuala Terengganu, which is generally the starting\r\n        point for a trip to the island resorts or to Tasik Kenyir National\r\n        Park.\r\n        The Islands\r\n        The islands off Terengganu?s north coast are accessible\r\n        from both Kuala Terengganu???where most of the resort companies have\r\n        booking offices???or by way of the fishing village of Kuala Besut, 45\r\n        km (28 miles) south of Kota Bharu, which is the departure point to\r\n        Pulau Perhentian?s islands. Before departing from Kuala Besut, a visit\r\n        can be made to Bukit Keluang, just on the coast, for swimming,\r\n        snorkeling, or windsurfing, with caves easily reached by walkways.\r\n        The islands of Pulau Perhentian Kecil and Pulau Perhentian\r\n        Besar are reached after a 21-km (13-mile) journey which takes up to two\r\n        hours. The islands? main reputations lie in their being lush and\r\n        tropical, with clear blue waters and coal reefs protected as part of\r\n        Malaysia?s marine parks. On both islands accommodations range from\r\n        lavish resorts to chalets to huts.\r\n        South from Pulau Perhentian Besar lies Pulau Redang, some\r\n        50 km (31 miles) off the coast, its nine islands making up the largest\r\n        of Terengganu?s archipelagoes. It is also developing quickly and is\r\n        strongly promoted by resort and travel agents in Kuala Terengganu,\r\n        though there still lies the promise of crystal-clear waters for scuba\r\n        diving. The journey to the islands takes two hours from the village of\r\n        Merang (not to be confused with the town of Marang farther south).\r\n        There are also resorts on Pulau Lang Tengah, just north from Redang\r\n        Islands. Boats take 45 minutes from Merang to reach the island.\r\n        Kuala Terengganu\r\n        This lively state capital, bordered by the Terengganu\r\n        River and the South China Sea, is the largest town in the state and has\r\n        fast progressed from a sleepy fishing village to a bustling, colorful\r\n        center. You?ll find a wide range of accommodations available, a\r\n        reflection perhaps of the state?s growing wealth due to offshore oil\r\n        recovery. Aside from the beautiful Masjid Tengku Tengah Zaharah, 41?2\r\n        km (3 miles) out of town, you?ll find most sites of interest along the\r\n        town?s waterfront. The mosque, built on an estuary of the Ibai River,\r\n        gives the illusion that it is floating on water.\r\n        Back in town, a waterfront stroll takes you through\r\n        Chinatown on Jalan Bandar. The old terraced buildings on both sides of\r\n        the road create an attractive sense of timelessness even as the betting\r\n        shops do a lively afternoon trade. Jalan Bandar leads you to the Pasar\r\n        Besar Kedai Payang (Central Market), a multi-level complex???attached\r\n        to a car park???with a fruit, vegetable, and fish market on the ground\r\n        floor and local textiles and handicrafts above.\r\n        For excellent views of the city, try the 200-m (219-ft)\r\n        high Bukit Puteri, a hill just beyond the market. Up the flight of\r\n        stairs you?ll find an old fort which was used in a local civil war in\r\n        the 19th century. The view overlooks the Istana Maziah, the sultan?s\r\n        palace, built in 1897, but it is not open to the public.\r\n        Behind the palace, the Masjid Zanial Abidin was originally\r\n        built of timber between 1793 and 1808. It was rebuilt in stone in 1852\r\n        and renovated in 1972.\r\n        A short river cruise from the jetty will take you to the\r\n        Pulau Duyung Besar, a little island where you can view the skills of\r\n        the boat-builders, whose reputations extend far beyond Malaysia. Many\r\n        of the builders? clientele for hardwood craft is more likely to be\r\n        wealthy American and Australian yachtsmen than the locals.\r\n        Several other attractions are located out of the town\r\n        proper. Opposite Pulau Sekati, 5 km (3 miles) from town???but also\r\n        accessible from the river???is the State Museum, housed in a\r\n        traditionally styled complex of four blocks housing ten galleries. For\r\n        local silk weaving, try the Sutera Semi Centre at Chendering, 6 km (3\r\n        miles) from Kuala Terengganu, where visitors can witness different\r\n        stages of silk-making and batik-painting. Also on offer is songket,\r\n        woven with silver and gold threads, and brassware.\r\n        Around Kuala Terengganu\r\n        Fifty-five kilometers (34 miles) inland from Kuala\r\n        Terengganu is the largest man-made lake in Southeast Asia, Tasik Kenyir\r\n        (Lake Kenyir), which was created by flooding the valley for\r\n        construction of the country?s largest hydroelectric dam, completed in\r\n        1985. For the angler with a taste for freshwater fish, Tasik Kenyir,\r\n        spanning over 38,000 hectares (260,000 acres) and 340 islands, is the\r\n        place. An international fishing competition is even held here. Besides\r\n        fishing, jet skiing, windsurfing, canoeing, and jungle trekking are all\r\n        available.\r\n        There are also several waterfalls, rapids, and cascades\r\n        within the lake region, including the Lasir, 16 km (10 miles) from the\r\n        gateway jetty at Pengkalan Gawi. This site is popular for picnics.\r\n        South from the Lake are the Sekayu Waterfalls, just 56 km (35 miles)\r\n        west of Kuala Terengganu. After trekking through the rainforest, you\r\n        can enjoy a swim in one of the many natural pools created among the\r\n        rocks by the cascading river.\r\n        Marang is a fishing village 15 km (9 miles) south of Kuala\r\n        Terengganu. Here and across the long wooden bridge at Patah Malam, you\r\n        may see fishermen peacefully mending their nets in the shade of coconut\r\n        palms. From Marang lies access to island of Pulau Kapas which, though\r\n        less than 2 km (1 mile) in length, is considered one of the most\r\n        pleasant islands on the east coast. There are several resorts and\r\n        chalet accommodations on the island.\r\n        Rantau Abang\r\n        Rantau Abang?s claim to fame comes through the giant\r\n        leatherback turtles that find their way to its beaches to lay their\r\n        precious eggs, as conservationists struggle to turn back the creatures?\r\n        declining numbers. The beach also attracts birds, including the\r\n        hawksbill, the common green, and the Oliver Ridley. The beach, 60 km\r\n        (38 miles) south of the Kuala Terengganu, is one of only six places in\r\n        the world visited by these turtles between the months of May and\r\n        September. During this time, a sanctuary extends 10 km (6 miles) on\r\n        either side of Rantau Abang. Special hatcheries have been set aside,\r\n        where the eggs are collected from the initial nest and reburied in a\r\n        safe location. A Turtle Information Centre is located north of the\r\n        village.\r\n        It is in the midnight to dawn hours that the female\r\n        leatherbacks, up to 21?2 m (8 ft) in length and weighing sometimes over\r\n        375 kg (825 lb), make their way up the beach. During daylight hours,\r\n        the beach?s sparkling waters and ambience are enough reason to\r\n        visit.\r\n        In the years before ecological awareness, the devastating\r\n        insensitivity of onlookers treated the turtles? rendezvous as a popular\r\n        spectacle. Crowds gathered in festive mood to build campfires on the\r\n        beach, dance to the blare of radios, photograph by blinding flashlight\r\n        the turtles? night-time egg laying, even ride the backs of the giant\r\n        leatherbacks and poke open their heavy-lidded eyes. This human\r\n        stupidity and sea pollution almost put a stop to this natural\r\n        phenomenon. The annual number of leatherbacks visiting Rantau Abang\r\n        declined from about 2,000 in the 1950s to barely a few hundred by the\r\n        end of the 1980s. At this point, the Malaysian fisheries department\r\n        stepped into protect the turtles. Authorities have banned the use of\r\n        flash photography or flashlights, and visitors must be 5 m (15 ft) from\r\n        the turtles. But still, not all will follow the guidelines. High tide\r\n        on a full moon is the most likely time to sight a leatherback coming\r\n        ashore, but there are no guarantees.\r\n        Tanjung Jara and Points South\r\n        The highway south from Rantau Abang, heading towards\r\n        Kuanten, the state capital of Pahang, passes through Tanjung Jara.\r\n        Here, the award-winning accommodations of the Beach Hotel contrast with\r\n        the rapid industrialization from the offshore oil and gas exploration\r\n        in the region. Farther south is Kuala Dungun, predominantly Chinese in\r\n        character and a location for excellent cuisine. A boat can be hired\r\n        from here to the island to Pulau Tenggol, 30 km (18 miles) offshore, so\r\n        you can go snorkeling among the angelfish. The center of Terengganu?s\r\n        petroleum industry is Kerteh, with its refineries and gasworks. But\r\n        there are some pretty beaches at the mouth of the Kerten River\r\n        nonetheless.\r\n        Pahang\r\n        The largest state in the peninsula also boasts the longest\r\n        river, the 475-km- (296-mile-) long Pahang. Although its most famous\r\n        sights lie far to the west in the Genting and Cameron Highlands, Padang\r\n        has its share of beach resorts, including the renowned Pulau Tioman\r\n        (Tioman Island) in the far south (though access by sea is from the port\r\n        of Mersing in Johor). The recently developed Endau Rompin State Park,\r\n        straddling the border with Johor state, compliments the better known\r\n        Taman Negara in the far north, which has its road access through the\r\n        state capital Kuanten. Padang?s other natural beauties include Lake\r\n        Chini.\r\n        The Coast\r\n        Just 47 km (30 miles) from Kuantan is the beach resort\r\n        area of Cherating, where Club Mediterran?e set up its first resort in\r\n        Asia. But Club Med is not alone along the beachfront. Other resorts in\r\n        close proximity to the state?s capital are located at Balok Beach. The\r\n        Hyatt Hotel Kuantan has joined other resorts at the Teluk Chempedak\r\n        Beach, only 5 km (3 miles) out of the bustling city. The beautiful\r\n        Pelindung Beach is just a short trek through the Teluk Chempedak Forest\r\n        Reserve. From May to September, green turtles and the occasional giant\r\n        leatherback may be seen under moonlight skies when they lay their eggs\r\n        on the beach. At the Beserah Beach, also close to Kuantan, the local\r\n        fishermen still employ buffalo to lead the carts carrying their catch\r\n        to the market, though a batik factory and several cottage handicraft\r\n        workshops may disappoint the more sophisticated souvenir-hunter. You\r\n        will find a pleasant beach nearby at Batu Hitam.\r\n        Kuantan\r\n        Despite a rather glum reputation among some guidebooks,\r\n        Kuantan township offers a wide range of hotels, a lively shopping and\r\n        market quarter, and a quiet ambience next to the river where good\r\n        eating stalls are found. Built on the fortunes from tin mining, the\r\n        capital is now a commercial center for Pahang?s oil, palm, and other\r\n        industries, and a key link in the East Coast petroleum and gas\r\n        pipelines.\r\n        You?ll find an array of Chinese hotels, which, like Hotel\r\n        Min Heng (1926) and the Tong Nam Ah Hotel, have interesting\r\n        backgrounds. The Mega View Hotel near the river tries to say it all in\r\n        its name. But there are also several new hotels near the river and in\r\n        sight of the impressive Masjid Negeri, such as the Shahzan Inn. On the\r\n        same street, Jalan Masjid, is the cultural center (Infokraf), and just\r\n        opposite is an open sports field. The area around Jalan A. Aziz and\r\n        Jalan Besar is hectic with shops, wares, and an occasional\r\n        money-lender. The local village of Selamat is known for its fine kain\r\n        songket silk brocade.\r\n        Just outside Kuantan is the Gua Charas, a cave temple 25\r\n        km (151?2 miles) northeast and built into one of the limestone outcrops\r\n        surrounding the town. Inside the cave, known as the ?yawning skull\r\n        cave,? echoing with the sound of bats, a 9-m (27-ft) reclining Buddha\r\n        is to be found among the illuminated shrines.\r\n        Pekan\r\n        The sleepy old royal capital of Pahang, 45 km (28 miles)\r\n        south of Kuantan, is still the sultan?s official residence. Upstream on\r\n        the Pahang River, the sultan?s gleaming palace, Istana Abu Bakar, is\r\n        set among immaculate green polo fields. Gilded and sapphire-blue domes\r\n        grace two white marble mosques and the sultan?s mausoleum. Nearby, the\r\n        old Victorian state museum displays glories of the old sultanate and\r\n        treasures of a Chinese junk salvaged from the South China Sea. The town\r\n        also boasts a silk-weaving center, located at Kampung Pulau Keladi, 5\r\n        km (3 miles) from Pekan.\r\n        Tasik Chini\r\n        Chini comprises a dozen beautiful lakes surrounded by\r\n        forested hills south of the Pehang River, 100 km (60 miles) west of\r\n        Kuantan. From June to September, much of the surface is covered by\r\n        white lotus blossoms. The myth-shrouded lakes are said to be the home\r\n        of giant snakes, dragons, and other monsters, one of which, according\r\n        to local myth, swam to the South China Sea to become Tioman Island.\r\n        Archeological explorations suggest there are ruins of a Khmer\r\n        settlement beneath the surface. Outside lotus-blossom season, the lakes\r\n        are still a delight to visit, with good fishing for the local toman.\r\n        Members of the local Jakun tribe dwell on the lakeshore. It may be\r\n        possible to pay a discreet visit to one of their hamlets, Kampung\r\n        Gumum.\r\n        Tioman Island\r\n        The combination of first-rate resort facilities and\r\n        magnificent natural beauty makes Tioman one of the finest islands in\r\n        Asia. Preserved from logging, most of the rainforest has remained. A\r\n        hilly ridge runs down the middle of the island at an altitude of 500 m\r\n        (1,640 ft), rising at the southern end to two granite peaks???the\r\n        ?Donkey?s Ears,? the taller of which, Mount Kajang, is 1,038 m (3,405\r\n        ft) high.\r\n        You can reach Tioman by flying from Kuantan or by taking\r\n        the boat from the fishing village of Mersing in Johor. The ?slow boat?\r\n        and the ?fast boat? both end up taking three to four hours.\r\n        On the island?s west coast, you have the choice between\r\n        the top-class Tioman Island Resort Hotel and the more modest but\r\n        comfortable guest-houses, chalets, and simpler cabins on Salang Beach\r\n        farther north. Facilities around the main island port of Tekek include\r\n        a golf course, where long-tailed macaques act as unofficial caddies who\r\n        do not always give the ball back.\r\n        Most trips around the island will be by boat, and the\r\n        fishermen charge a reasonable fee. From Tekek, make the Jungle Trek\r\n        over the hill to the east coast. Cool off on the way with a dip at the\r\n        hilltop waterfall, them make your way down to the beach at Juara, a\r\n        village serving excellent seafood and banana pancakes. Take another\r\n        swim in the sea, and if you do not feel like trekking back, return to\r\n        Tekek by boat.\r\n        Birdwatchers will see green pied imperial pigeons,\r\n        bulbuls, frigate birds, sunbirds, and flower-peckers.\r\n        Characteristically for island forests, there are no large mammals.\r\n        Hollywood, having recently filmed the remake of The King\r\n        and I on Langkawi Island in 1999, had earlier made Tioman the idyllic\r\n        location for the musical South Pacific, and near Mukut at the island?s\r\n        southern tip you can see the waterfall where Mitzi Gaynor decided to\r\n        ?wash that man right out of [her] hair. ?\r\n        Johor\r\n        The peninsula?s southernmost state, Johor?s proximity to\r\n        Singapore has added buoyancy to the state?s economy and also to that of\r\n        its capital, Johor Bahru. Easy access from Singapore to east-coast\r\n        resorts such as Desaru on the southeast and the islands offshore from\r\n        Mersing has also led to the increased development of these\r\n        destinations. Johor?s links to Singapore have renewed and solidified\r\n        its position as a guardian of Malay culture since it first provided a\r\n        refuge in the 16th century for the Melaka. Johor offers travelers a\r\n        wide range of opportunities for tourism, from shopping to motor racing,\r\n        equestrian to water sports, and not to mention adventure travel to the\r\n        Endau Rompin National Park, the relatively untouched forests that flank\r\n        the border with Pahang.\r\n        The Endau-Rompin National Park\r\n        Straddling the border between Johor and Pahang,\r\n        Endau-Rompin National Park?s 870 sq km(539 sq miles) of jungle and\r\n        rivers is fast gaining a reputation among travelers as an alternative\r\n        to the elder Taman Negara. The park is home to tigers, elephants, wild\r\n        boar, and the largest surviving population of Sumatran rhinoceros in\r\n        peninsular Malaysia. Other species to be found here include the\r\n        binturong (bear cat) and the white-handed gibbon, the only ape species\r\n        in the region. Among bird-life are chirping drongos, hornbills, and\r\n        argus pheasant. The Endau Rompin is also home to the Orang Asli of the\r\n        Jakun tribe.\r\n        Much less developed than the parks of Sarawak and\r\n        Sabah???and so much more pristine???Endau-Rompin offers a unique\r\n        challenge to the adventurous traveler, but facilities for accommodation\r\n        remain limited, with only four campsites in the park, able to\r\n        accommodate between 250 and 300 visitors. These are located at Kuala\r\n        Jasin, Batu Hampar, Upeh Guling, and Kuala Marong. You must employ a\r\n        guide or go on a group tour.\r\n        From Johor Bahru, traveling by the north?south highway,\r\n        upon reaching Kluang, detour to the Kahang town. From there, only a\r\n        four-wheel drive vehicle will take you along the 56-km (35-mile) jungle\r\n        track to Kampung Peta, where there is a visitor center and point of\r\n        entry to the national parks. Otherwise, you can get there via a\r\n        three-hour boat journey from Felda Nitar II. There are also a wide\r\n        range of quite strident regulations governing park usage and duration\r\n        periods.\r\n        Desaru and the Islands North\r\n        The southeast corner of the peninsula was originally\r\n        exploited only for its oil-palm plantations. Today, tourism drives the\r\n        economy, and its high-class hotels share 25 km (15 miles) of golden\r\n        sands. Desaru is accessible by road by way of Kota Tinggi, or by\r\n        following the coast road from Johor Bahru. If traveling through Kota\r\n        Tinggi, it might be worthwhile to make a stopover to see the\r\n        spectacular waterfall at Lembong, 15 km (91?2 miles) north from the\r\n        town center. Desaru is 52 km (32 miles) farther east and is the first\r\n        major beach resort outside Singapore. There are several top-end resorts\r\n        and golf courses here, including the Desaru Golden Beach Hotel and\r\n        Resort and the Desaru View Hotel, but budget travelers will also find\r\n        chalet accommodation available.\r\n        Off the coast from the resorts of Mersing, there are\r\n        several islands???Pulau Rawa, Pulau Tengah, Pulau Besar, Pulau Tinggi,\r\n        and Pulau Sibu???offering white sandy beaches, coral reefs, and budget\r\n        accommodations. Boats can be hired from Mersing to take you out to one\r\n        of the secluded lagoons.\r\n        Johor Bahru\r\n        Citizens of prosperous but staid Singapore cross the\r\n        causeway to Johor?s state capital to escape for the weekend and sample\r\n        its lively nightlife, to shop, or to head farther north. Outside the\r\n        restaurants and malls, visitors can visit the sprawling market, and\r\n        nearby along the Lido Waterfront take a look at the gleaming white\r\n        marble of the Sultan Abu Bakar Mosque, the Royal Museum, and the Istana\r\n        Gardens of the old palace with its Japanese tea house and zoo put\r\n        together from the sultan?s private menagerie.\r\n        The neoclassical Istana Besar Palace is now used only for\r\n        state ceremonies, the present-day sultans having moved up the coast to\r\n        the modern Istana Bukit Serene, with its 32-m- (104-ft-) high tower.\r\n        Other sights include the colonial-style clock tower overlooking the\r\n        Datan Bandaraya (City Square). The Johor Art Gallery building (1910),\r\n        built in a similar period style, exhibits clothing, weapons, currency,\r\n        and manuscripts, as well as examples of calligraphy and ceramic items\r\n        along with artworks.\r\n        North Towards Melaka\r\n        Two roads???Jalan Tun Dr. Ismail and Jalan Tun Abdul\r\n        Razak???lead northward out of Jahor Bahru to the west coast. But not\r\n        far from Taman Tasik they combine into one in the direction of Ayer\r\n        Hitam. But before heading towards Melaka, gourmets turn off west at\r\n        Sekudai to the coast road and back south to Kukup, a small fishing\r\n        village 40 km (25 miles) southwest of Johor Bahru.\r\n        At Ayer Hitam, a wide range of Chinese-style pottery is on\r\n        display beside the fruit market, where there is an excellent selection\r\n        of rambutans, pineapples, and bananas, as well as locally made nougat\r\n        and fruit-cakes. The market town of of Batu Pahat also offers\r\n        respectable Chinese restaurants. The town witnessed a historic Melaka\r\n        naval victory over the Thai fleet in 1456. The fishing port of Muar was\r\n        of trading importance to the British in the 19th century, as can be\r\n        seen in the graceful old Neo-Classical government offices. It was also\r\n        the scene of the Australian troops? heroic but abortive last stand\r\n        against the Japanese advance on Singapore in January 1942.\r\n        Sarawak and Sabah\r\n        From jungles to mountains, the states of Sarawak and Sabah\r\n        offer enough adventure and natural beauty to make the journey across\r\n        the South China Sea worthwhile. These sections of Borneo???whose name\r\n        has miraculously not lost its romantic magic???are sorely tried by the\r\n        modern onslaughts of oil drilling, voracious logging of lucrative\r\n        belian hardwood, and of tourism itself. But such images as\r\n        cloud-engulfed mountain-tops, a tattooed and decorated Iban at a\r\n        riverside longhouse, a bustling produce market, a beachside retreat\r\n        bordering upon turquoise waters, or an orang-utan sitting in lazy\r\n        attitude all mark some side of the genuine adventure which awaits the\r\n        traveler in East Malaysia. From shopping for exotic souvenirs and\r\n        craftwork to dining in a seaside restaurants to the thrill of riding in\r\n        a longboat along river ?highways? deep in the forests, it is all there\r\n        for the choosing.\r\n        The history of the ?White Rajah????the lineage that\r\n        commenced with adventurer James Brooke in the 1830s and lasted until\r\n        the start of World War II???still lies intact in Kuching, Sawawak?s\r\n        capital.\r\n        But away from the cities lies some natural prizes:\r\n        Borneo?s highest mountain (Mt. Kinabalu in Sabah), its longest river\r\n        (the Rejang in Sarawak), its myriad caves (including the Niah Caves in\r\n        Sarawak), and natural parks to see the wondrous wildlife and\r\n        flora???they all await. For a change of pace, there are plenty of\r\n        beaches along the southern and eastern coasts and plenty of islands for\r\n        snorkeling or turtle-watching.\r\n        Getting around can be a challenge. The rivers, more\r\n        numerous and much longer than on the peninsula, still provide the\r\n        principal way into the interior, supplemented by smaller aircraft\r\n        operated by Malaysia Airlines.\r\n        Sarawak\r\n        It is 90 minutes by air from Kuala Lumpur to Kuching, the\r\n        historic capital of Malaysia?s largest state???covering 124,967 sq km\r\n        (48,250 sq miles). From the air you?ll be able to see that Sarawak\r\n        boasts the country?s longest river, the Rejang, flowing 563 km (351\r\n        miles) from the mountains on the Indonesian border to the South China\r\n        Sea. The wealth of river systems among the jungle terrain provides a\r\n        vital link that will transport you to the tribes of the rainforest and\r\n        the chance to experience life in their longhouses first-hand. Between\r\n        river cruises or treks through the rainforest of Bako National Park,\r\n        you can relax at the beachside of Santubong and Damai, just 40 minutes\r\n        from Kuching. In eastern Sarawak, you can pursue more strenuous but\r\n        exhilarating adventures in the Niah or Mulu cave systems.\r\n        Don?t be surprised if upon arrival on a domestic flight\r\n        you are asked to show your passport for immigration formalities.\r\n        Kuching\r\n        Unlike the other major towns of East Malaysia???Miri, Kota\r\n        Kinabalu, or Sandakan???Sarawak?s state capital has preserved its\r\n        colonial charm, having been spared the bombs of World War II. Kuching\r\n        is built on a bend of the Sarawak River, 32 km (20 miles) from the sea.\r\n        The residence and fort built by the White Rajahs (see page 25) lie on\r\n        the north bank, while on the southern bank is the greater part of the\r\n        town, including Chinese and Indian merchants, major hotels, and several\r\n        colonial buildings, the past?s permanent vestiges.\r\n        The colonial buildings include the General Post Office,\r\n        noteworthy for its 1930s Neo-Classical design and pillars, and the\r\n        Courthouse. The courthouse site was originally a German Lutheran\r\n        mission before James Brooke, the first of the White Rajahs, turned it\r\n        into a judicial administration office. In 1858 that building was\r\n        demolished, making away for a second and later a third structure (the\r\n        one that still stands), which was completed in 1874. State Council\r\n        meetings continued to be held there until 1973. Today it houses the\r\n        High Court and Magistrates Court. The clock tower, whose bells still\r\n        chime on the hour, was added in 1883. In front of the courthouse is the\r\n        Charles Brooke Memorial, six meters in height, which was built in 1924\r\n        in remembrance of the Second White Rajah.\r\n        Along the Esplanade, north of the courthouse, is the\r\n        Square Tower, and on its ground floor is an information center and\r\n        multimedia theater.\r\n        West of the Courthouse is Jalan India, a pedestrian mall\r\n        marking the city?s Muslim center. Sarawak?s oldest Indian Mosque, built\r\n        in the 1850s, is here. Still farther west, the Kuching Mosque, built in\r\n        1968, located near the markets, is best seen from the other side of the\r\n        river. A new mosque has also been built on the north side of the\r\n        River.\r\n        The main Central Market is located on Jalan Gambier, near\r\n        the esplanade. Here fresh fish, poultry, and vegetables are sold, as\r\n        well as clothes, newspapers, and CDs. Nearby are the bus terminal and\r\n        taxi stand.\r\n        Despite new high-rise construction underway, the myriad\r\n        traditional shophouses???both Chinese and Indian???ensure the city?s\r\n        former qualities are still within reach. Chinese shophouses along Jalan\r\n        Padungan, mostly built during the rubber boom of the 1920s and 1930s,\r\n        offer a variety of restaurants, coffee houses, and handicraft\r\n        shops.\r\n        More colorful is the Sunday Market on Jalan Satok at Jalan\r\n        Palm, which actually starts late Saturday and extends through Sunday\r\n        morning, offering a bewildering array of items; Dayaks come to sell\r\n        fruit, vegetables, and handicrafts and even more exotic items from the\r\n        forest, such as lizards, bats, monkeys, and turtles.\r\n        East of the Courthouse, the Tua Pek Ko ng Temple and the\r\n        Chinese History Museum are near the group of grand, five-star hotels\r\n        that line the river. The temple, also known as the Siew San Teng\r\n        Temple, was built in 1876 and is the oldest in Kuching; it remains an\r\n        active place of worship. The nearby museum traces the long history of\r\n        the Chinese, who lived in Borneo well before the arrival of the James\r\n        Brooke, in Sarawak. Another temple is the Kuek Seng Ong Temple, on\r\n        Lebuh Wayang, built in 1895. Finally, the Lim Fah San Monastery\r\n        Association is located on Jalan Sampang Tua.\r\n        For a fee of 30 sen (one way) venture across the Sarawak\r\n        River by tambang (ferry) to the view the Astana (1870) and Fort\r\n        Margherita (1879). The Astana (which means ?palace? in Malay), was\r\n        originally the Brooke?s home. It is comprised of three bungalows under\r\n        a single roof and built above the ground supported by brick pillars.\r\n        The building has a library and a collection of artifacts associated\r\n        with the Brooke family. The ground floor was the location for many\r\n        garden parties hosted by the Rajahs; it was also used an internment\r\n        center for Japanese prisoners of war during World War II. It is now the\r\n        residence of the Governor of Kuching, the Yang Di-Pertuan Negeri. Set\r\n        among beautiful grounds, it is unfortunately not open to the\r\n        public.\r\n        Up the hill to the right from the Astana, the road leads\r\n        to Fort Margherita, now the Muzium Polis (Police Museum). The\r\n        white-turreted edifice was built by Sir Charles Brooke along the lines\r\n        of a English medieval castle and named after his wife, Margaret. It was\r\n        converted to a museum in 1971 and is now open Tuesdays through Fridays\r\n        from 10am to 6pm. You may need your passport to gain a free pass to\r\n        enter the museum. Inside, there are displays of police weapons and\r\n        simulated opium dens, plus scenes of punishments once meted out to\r\n        prisoners. A skull house in the museum, there as a form of protection,\r\n        offers a grisly reminder of another side of Borneo?s history.\r\n        Back on the south side of the river, another colonial\r\n        building is the Round Tower on Jalan Tun Abang Haji Openg. It was\r\n        originally designed as a dispensary when built in the 1880s.\r\n        Also south of the river on Jalan Tun Haji Openg is the\r\n        Sawarak Museum, which has one of the best collections of folk art and\r\n        flora and fauna in Southeast Asia. The museum is divided between the\r\n        old wing and the new wing, connected by a footbridge across the road.\r\n        The former was built in 1891 and styled along the lines of a Normandy\r\n        townhouse; it is devoted to Sawarak?s rich history and many cultures.\r\n        The new wing, completed in 1983, has more galleries and archeological\r\n        exhibits, including a reconstruction of the early human settlements at\r\n        the Niah Caves. There is a bookstore and souvenir shop.\r\n        Within the Museum?s grounds there is an Aquarium, the\r\n        Botantic Gardens, and the Heroes Memorial, the latter commemorating the\r\n        dead from World War II, the Emergency, and the Confrontation with\r\n        Indonesia. Adjacent to the new wing of the Sarawak Museum is the Muzium\r\n        Islam (Islamic Museum).\r\n        Highlights of the Old Wing include a reconstructed Iban\r\n        Longhouse, complete with totem-pole, chieftains? hornbill-feather\r\n        headdresses, and skulls of head-hunting victims; Kenyah Tree of Life\r\n        Mural, repainted from a longhouse at Long Nawang; Melanau dolls, which\r\n        serve as charms against disease and to lure animals to traps; beads of\r\n        the Kelabit people; and specimens of Alfred Russell Wallace?s extensive\r\n        insect collection.\r\n        The New Wing has galleries of Hindu and Buddhist\r\n        Sculptures; Chinese, Thai, Japanese, and European ceramics and\r\n        brassware; a model of the Niah Caves (see page 122), with their birds,\r\n        bats, and other fauna, Stone Age artifacts, and funeral boats from the\r\n        eighth century a.d. A photographic history of Kuching is also\r\n        rewarding.\r\n        Kuching also claims the world?s first Cat Museum, in honor\r\n        of the city?s mascot (kuching means ?cat? in Malay; see page 115).\r\n        Around Kuching\r\n        The fishing village and peninsula of Santubong is just 40\r\n        minutes from Kuching. There you will find beach resorts and cultural\r\n        sights, plus opportunities for jungle trekking, bike riding, and golf.\r\n        Mount Santubong (810 m/2,470?ft), peers down on the broad, sandy\r\n        beaches of Damai, where you will find resorts along the long, sandy\r\n        beach. Nearby is the Sarawak Cultural Park, 7 hectares (17 acres) of\r\n        craft demonstrations and cultural performances. Described as a ?Living\r\n        Museum,? it provides an opportunity for the traveler short on time to\r\n        gain a feel for the rich culture of Sarawak. Full- or half-day tours\r\n        are offered, with regular shuttles available from Kuching.\r\n        There are three beach resorts and a rainforest resort at\r\n        Damai, each offering a range of water sports, jungle trekking trips,\r\n        and cultural activities. Two of the resorts, both located at Teluk\r\n        Penyuk Beach, are managed by the Holiday Inn chain and are within easy\r\n        reach of the Cultural Park. Outside the Cultural Park, there is access\r\n        to local longhouses as well as trips to the Bako National Park, local\r\n        fishing villages, and nearby islands, and river cruises around the\r\n        Santubong Peninsula.\r\n        In Sarawak there is one major center involved with the\r\n        rehabilitation of the orang-utan. The Matang Wildlife Centre, 35 km (22\r\n        miles) from Kuching, is to take over the role of Semengoh, which no\r\n        longer maintains captive animals. At Matang, while the focus of their\r\n        work is on the orang-utans, there are enclosures for Sambar deer,\r\n        crocodiles, sun bears, civets, and bear cats, as well as aviaries\r\n        holding hornbills, sea eagles, and other bird life from Sarawak.\r\n        Bako National Parks\r\n        Both Bako National Park and Kubah National Park are within\r\n        easy reach of Kuching. As Sarawak?s oldest national park, Bako is also\r\n        one of the smallest, covering just 27 sq km (10 sq miles), but it\r\n        offers great opportunities to see a wide range of animal and plant\r\n        life. Since the park is located just one hour (37 km/23 miles) from\r\n        Kuching, the visitor has a choice between a day trip or an overnight\r\n        stay; accommodations include a resthouse, dormitories, and chalets. You\r\n        must first travel to Kampung Bako, where you can get a boat to\r\n        transport you to the park headquarters at Telok Assam. The long-nosed,\r\n        paunchy proboscis monkey is the major attraction, but also to be seen\r\n        are silver leaf monkeys and long-tail macaques. Mouse-deer, monitor\r\n        lizards, and bird life, including sea eagles, also live here.\r\n        Bako offers 16 well-marked, color-coded jungle trails with\r\n        bridges over the swamps to the best spots for viewing flora and\r\n        wildlife. Twelve of the trails lead off from the right of the park?s\r\n        headquarters, just across from the arrival jetty. The Jalan Tanjong\r\n        Sepi, a 30-minute steep climb up to the cliff-tops overlooking the bay\r\n        that fronts the park headquarters, is recommended.\r\n        On the Jalan Lintang, a small observation hide at the\r\n        Lintang Salt Lick offers the chance to see the animals at close\r\n        quarters as they drink. Besides its good hilltop view over the jungle,\r\n        the Jalan Bukit Tambi offers several specimens of carnivorous plants:\r\n        the bladderwort, pitcher plant, and sundew???also known as Venus?s\r\n        fly-trap.\r\n        The Jalan Telok Delima and Jalan Telok Paku are the best\r\n        trails for viewing the proboscis monkey; they like to bed down in a\r\n        tree near the seashore. Very often, they will have been watching you\r\n        long before you spot them, and if your presence upsets them, they will\r\n        just honk and disappear. While at the seashore, keep a look out, too,\r\n        for the hairy-nosed otter.\r\n        Longhouse River Cruises\r\n        The opportunity to see the tribes of Sarawak in their\r\n        forest homes is a privilege not to be missed. However, tours to some\r\n        longhouses have acquired the artificial character of a ?tribal theme\r\n        park. ? Unfortunately, as tourism rises and the popularity of such\r\n        expeditions increases, it is a trend difficult to escape, the only real\r\n        alternative being to travel even farther into the forests at added\r\n        expense. But the adoption by some villagers of western clothing or such\r\n        items as televisions and radios shouldn?t daunt the visitor.\r\n        On offer for the soft adventure traveler is a choice\r\n        between a day trip, an overnight stay at a guest house near a\r\n        longhouse, or a stay in a longhouse itself. Tours from Kuching usually\r\n        start very early and involve a two- to five-hour road journey to the\r\n        river and then a one-hour cruise by longboat. Tour operators usually\r\n        have exclusive arrangements with particular longhouses.\r\n        The format of the visit varies, but it may include\r\n        cultural performances soon after arrival for day-trippers or at the\r\n        day?s end as evening entertainment for those staying longer. The\r\n        standard tour is an initial orientation to the longhouse, highlighting\r\n        the bilik (apartments) as distinct from the ruai (communal areas). Tour\r\n        groups are often greeted with tuak, a sweet wine made from glutinous\r\n        rice, and a welcome dance. The musical and cultural performance\r\n        includes a ngajat, a traditional Iban dance. Demonstrations of the\r\n        blowpipe and cockfighting are also likely to be on the agenda.\r\n        Before you leave, your tour guide will remind you to make\r\n        sure that you have gifts???cigarettes, sweets, and little toys for the\r\n        children???which can be bought during one of the bus stopovers earlier\r\n        in the day. Malaysian tourism authorities may also be able to offer\r\n        advice on reputable tour operators in Kuching who organize visits on a\r\n        small scale so as not to offend tribal dignity.\r\n        Around Kuching visitors are likely to visit a longhouse of\r\n        the Iban tribe, but tours are also available to Bidayuh longhouses\r\n        found in the hill regions. Visits to the Iban are likely along the\r\n        Skrang or Batang-ai river. To the east of Kuching you can visit the\r\n        Kenyah and Kayan tribes. Excursions are organized either via Miri from\r\n        Kuala Baram along the majestic Baram River, or via Sibu, from Kapit or\r\n        Belaga, up the Rejang River. The Rejang is considered Malaysia?s\r\n        greatest river at some 560 km (350 miles) long; a journey along the\r\n        river is considered one of the world?s last great travel adventures.\r\n        The approach to Belaga entails a passage through the Rejang?s Pelegus\r\n        Rapids. There are seven in all, each with its own name: Bidai (big\r\n        mat), Nabau (python), Lunggak (dagger), Pantu (sago), Sukat (measure),\r\n        Mawang (fruit), and most ominously, Rapoh (tomb).\r\n        Niah Caves\r\n        At the Niah Caves visitors see the earliest traces of homo\r\n        sapiens in Malaysia; they lived in the area up to 40,000 years ago.\r\n        Later the caves were used as a burial ground, and they are now the\r\n        hunting-ground of collectors of the cave-roof bird?s nests. The caves\r\n        and surrounding 3,149-hectare (7,775-acre) park are 480 km (300 miles)\r\n        up the coast from Kuching, hidden within the Miri Forests.\r\n        Adventurer A. Hart Everett came across the caves in the\r\n        1870s, but it was not until 1958 that local explorer and Sarawak Museum\r\n        curator Tom Harrison made the important discovery of a human skull\r\n        dating back some 37,000 years, together with 1,200-year-old red\r\n        hematite rock paintings. The fragments of the Deep Skull (so-called\r\n        because it was found deep within an ancient pile of bat guano),\r\n        together with tools, earthenware pots, jars, and later bronze jewelry\r\n        found nearby are on display at the Kuching Museum.\r\n        The park, near the town of Batu Niah, is midway between\r\n        the towns of Bintulu and Miri, a boomtown known for its oil exploration\r\n        and recovery. The caves are accessible by road from either town, taking\r\n        at least two hours from Miri and three hours from Bintulu. The park?s\r\n        headquarters is at Pangkalan Lubang, and you will need to obtain a\r\n        permit either here or in the town of Miri. From here, you cross the\r\n        Sungei Niah (or Niah River) by sampan, then follow the 3-km (2-mile)\r\n        plank walkway to the caves. For the cave tour, be sure to take a\r\n        powerful flashlight, sturdy walking shoes with a good grip, and a\r\n        change of clothes???the humidity is quite intense.\r\n        The Traders Cave is the first to be seen, so-called\r\n        because of its role as a meeting place of bird?s nest-gatherers and\r\n        merchants. The original Niah people?s decline is something of a\r\n        mystery; their forefathers may be the nomadic Penan, who traded the\r\n        nests and hornbill ivory for Chinese porcelain and beads.\r\n        The main or Great Cave is a hollow 400 m (1,1312 ft) up in\r\n        the sandstone Subis plateau. Besides some giant crickets and scorpions\r\n        (from which the extension of the boardwalk through the cave keeps you\r\n        safe), the Great Cave is home to millions of bats and swiftlets. The\r\n        Deep Skull and other relics were discovered here.\r\n        The bats? daily droppings furnish one ton of highly valued\r\n        guano fertilizer. But more lucrative than the guano are the swiftlets?\r\n        edible nests, for which Chinese merchants are prepared to pay hundreds\r\n        of dollars per kilo (of about 100 nests), reselling them for thousands,\r\n        to make bird?s-nest soup. Park authorities are increasingly concerned\r\n        about the impact of the on-going harvest on the swiftlets? survival.\r\n        The rush of nesting swiftlets flying into the cave at day?s end while\r\n        the nocturnal bats rush past into the evening sky is a spectacular\r\n        sight.\r\n        The boardwalk continues through the Great Cave down to the\r\n        Painted Cave, also accessible without a guide. Discovered in 1958 along\r\n        with the Deep Skull, its wall-paintings representing red stick figures\r\n        of spread-eagle dancers were executed in a mixture of betel juice and\r\n        lime around a.d. 700. This cave was probably also used as a burial\r\n        chamber.\r\n        Nearby are the several jungle trails, with the Jalan Bukit\r\n        Kasut and the Jalan Madu both clearly marked. Be on the lookout for the\r\n        long-tailed macaques, together with a range of bird-life such as\r\n        bulbuls, tailor birds, crested wood partridges, trogons, and\r\n        hornbills.\r\n        Gunung Mulu National Park\r\n        Offering spectacular visions of one of the world?s largest\r\n        limestone cave system, the relatively new Gunung Mulu National Park\r\n        (53,000 hectares/130,600 acres) is one Sawarak?s most important\r\n        attractions. The cave system of 150 km (almost 100 miles) was first\r\n        explored between 1976 to 1984 and requires a minimum two day/one night\r\n        stay to be fully appreciated. The trip is a quite demanding adventure,\r\n        and you need to be in good shape, especially if you are looking to\r\n        undertake the climb to the limestone-sculptured pinnacles on Gunung Api\r\n        (Fire Mountain).\r\n        A 35-minute flight from Miri arrives at the airstrip near\r\n        the park?s headquarters. The alternative (by land and boat) also starts\r\n        from Miri and is a four-stage trip. First, you travel by bus or taxi to\r\n        Kuala Baram, at the mouth of the Batang Baram. From here, you take an\r\n        express boat to Marudi before meeting up with the noon boat to Long\r\n        Terawan, followed by a third longboat along the Sungei Tutoh and Sungei\r\n        Melanau to the park?s headquarters. This is the only alternative to the\r\n        air trip and requires almost a full day of travel by bus and boat;\r\n        while still available???and recommended for the return journey???the\r\n        flight from Miri over rainforest in a 19-seat Twin Otter plane is\r\n        considered the best way to begin your stay at Mulu.\r\n        There are four main ?show caves? at Mulu???Deer, Lang?s,\r\n        Clearwater, and Wind???as well as countless other ?wild caves,? which\r\n        are either too dangerous or too ecologically fragile to visit without\r\n        special permits and qualified guides.\r\n        Away from the show caves, expect some crawling around on\r\n        hands and knees or wading chest-deep through underground streams. The\r\n        best guides will provide miner?s helmets with built-in lamps to explore\r\n        the pitch-black caves. Your own equipment should include very strong\r\n        shoes made of rubber than than leather, lots of socks, tough old\r\n        clothes, a pair of gloves, and a light sleeping bag.\r\n        To give you an idea of the scale of the caverns, Sarawak\r\n        Chamber, the most recently explored cave (and reputed to be the largest\r\n        cave in the world) is said to be capable of holding 40 jumbo jets.\r\n        Although the Sarawak Chamber had been closed to the public in recent\r\n        years, tours began again in late 1998; if you wish to see this chamber,\r\n        be sure to ask when making your arrangements to see if it can still be\r\n        visited.\r\n        Nearest to the park?s headquarters are the Deer Cave and\r\n        Lang?s Cave. The Deer Cave, with an enormous entrance and a passage 2\r\n        km (about 1 mile) long and up to 220 m (670?ft) high, had been a\r\n        shelter for deer. It is uncertain whether it was also used as a human\r\n        burial ground, as other caves in the system were used. Like many other\r\n        large, open caves, it is home to millions of bats, which fly out in a\r\n        cloud at dusk in search for food. Noteworthy is ?Adam and Eve?s\r\n        shower,? a cascade of water falling 120 m (366 ft) from the cave?s\r\n        ceiling. Deep within the cave???after about an hour?s walking???is a\r\n        hidden green valley known as the Garden of Eden.\r\n        Lang?s Cave, nearby, was once inhibited by wild boars, and\r\n        although smaller, it has a variety of stalactites and stalagmites and\r\n        spectacular rock curtains.\r\n        The Clearwater and Wind caves are reached by longboat from\r\n        the park?s headquarters. The Clearwater cave?s passage extends for 50\r\n        km (31 miles). You?ll need to have a good flashlight on hand???in order\r\n        to see the limestone formations???after passing the moss-covered\r\n        stalactites near the entrance. The Wind Cave is accessible to hardy\r\n        cavers near the Clearwater cave, but other visitors must make their\r\n        entry from the river.\r\n        Exploring the Pinnacles, 900 m (3,000 ft) up the side of\r\n        Mount Api, will add extra days to the tour, but there are few sights to\r\n        match these gigantic stone needles thrusting like petrified hooded\r\n        ghosts above the dark green canopy of the forest. Extra time, too, is\r\n        required if you with to attempt the climb up Mount Mulu (2,376 m/7,793\r\n        ft), whose summit was successfully reached by Lord Shackelton in 1932\r\n        after earlier known attempts in the nineteenth century had failed. The\r\n        climb of Mount Mulu can alone can take up to five days, although\r\n        ?expert? climbers have made the journey in less than two.\r\n        The richness of the park?s flora and fauna has been the\r\n        topic of many scientific studies. The accumulation of data has revealed\r\n        1,500 species of flowering plants, 20,000 animal species, 8,000\r\n        varieties of fungi, 262 species of bird, 50 species of reptiles, and\r\n        280 species of butterfly. Bird-life includes stork-billed kingfishers,\r\n        myna birds, and strawhead bulbuls.\r\n        Sabah\r\n        Covering the northern tip of Borneo, Sabah lies just clear\r\n        of the cyclones that regularly sweep down across the Philippines, and\r\n        so has been dubbed by generations of sailors the ?Land Below the Winds.\r\n        ? Its capital, Kota Kinabalu???popularly known as KK???looks out on the\r\n        South China Sea, with the Sulu to the northeast and the Sulawesi seas\r\n        to the south.\r\n        KK lies in the shadow of the Crocker Mountain Range, home\r\n        of Mount Kinabalu, Southeast Asia?s tallest mountain at 4,101 m (13,454\r\n        ft). The Kinabalu national park is just one of six protected regions in\r\n        the state.\r\n        The capital serves as a landing-stage for visits to an\r\n        offshore national park of coral islands. On the east coast, Sandakan\r\n        provides a base for visiting the Turtle Islands and the famous\r\n        orang-utans of Sepilok. Fishing, snorkeling, deep sea diving, leisurely\r\n        coral cruises in the beautiful waters surrounding Sabah, or just\r\n        exploring KK?s markets are some choices available to the visitor.\r\n        Kota Kinabalu\r\n        Known as Jesselton (after Sir Charles Jessel, chairman of\r\n        the North Borneo Chartered Co.) until World War II, Kota Kinabalu was\r\n        renamed Api (?fire?) by the occupying Japanese. Today?s KK was rebuilt\r\n        from the ashes of the war after allied bombing razed the city during\r\n        the Japanese occupation. KK is at present a prosperous and busy\r\n        seaport, with a growing manufacturing base and a population of 200,000;\r\n        for the tourist there are numerous shopping centers. Rebuilt in a\r\n        modern style, it is blessed with a beautiful natural setting: tree-clad\r\n        coral islands off the coast and the dramatic backdrop of Mount Kinabalu\r\n        to the west. The city is generally used as a base for visiting the\r\n        surrounding national parks.\r\n        You?ll find a tourist information office (a former post\r\n        office) on Jalan Gaya (this and the Atkinson Clock Tower are two the\r\n        few pre-war structures still standing).\r\n        The large, golden dome of the State Mosque, at the corner\r\n        of Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman and Jalan Penempang, can be seen as you\r\n        come into town from the airport. Nearby is the Sabah State Museum on\r\n        Jalan Museum, which is open only from Saturday to Thursday. The Museum\r\n        is styled along the lines of Murut and Rungus longhouses, set on\r\n        grounds where you will also find several steam engines. Its historic\r\n        photograph collection provides a chance to see the township as it was\r\n        before the war.\r\n        Next door is the Science and Technology Centre and an Art\r\n        Gallery. Across from the museum is an Ethnobotanic Garden, offering\r\n        opportunities to see a range of tropical plants.\r\n        On the north side of town is the gleaming Sabah Foundation\r\n        building, a 30-story cylinder mounted on a polygonal pedestal and\r\n        looking like a flat-topped space rocket. Construction of the tower came\r\n        from timber royalties to the state, after the foundation, which is\r\n        devoted to state educational projects, was established in 1966. This\r\n        tower offers a great view of the city.\r\n        One block east of Jalan Gaya is the Atkinson Clock Tower,\r\n        built in 1905. Walk up the hill to try the view from the Signal Hill\r\n        Observatory. One of the most popular markets in town is the Jalan Gaya\r\n        Street Market, held every Sunday morning. At the waterfront can be\r\n        found the Filipino Market, near the general and fish markets.\r\n        The Coral Islands\r\n        Just a brief boat ride from KK are the five islands of the\r\n        Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park, which was created in 1974. Boats can\r\n        be rented at the waterfront, near the Hyatt Hotel, for either a group\r\n        or individual tour to the islands. All five islands lie within a\r\n        five-mile radius and provide first-class beaches and superb\r\n        opportunities for swimming and snorkeling, and there are boardwalk\r\n        trails into the islands? jungle interior.\r\n        Pulau Gaya is the largest of the coral islands. The\r\n        national park headquarters here can give you information about the\r\n        flora and fauna, both underwater and in the forest. The sandy Police\r\n        Beach on the north shore is good for swimming and exploring marine life\r\n        among the coral reefs. On the boardwalk trail across a mangrove swamp\r\n        forest, look out for monkeys, bearded pigs, and giant-beaked pied\r\n        hornbills.\r\n        Some of the best nature trails are on neighboring Pulau\r\n        Sapi, a 25-acre islet off the northwestern coast of Pulau Gaya. South\r\n        of Sapi is Palau Manukan, where the park?s headquarters are located and\r\n        where you can get information on the islands? flora and fauna. Here,\r\n        too, are chalets, a restaurant, swimming pool, and tennis and squash\r\n        courts. Tiny Pulau Mamutik is the smallest of the group, covering just\r\n        15 acres, but it is largely unspoiled, with plenty of reefs at its\r\n        northeastern end; it is very popular with divers and snorkelers. The\r\n        remotest and least developed island, with the park?s finest coral reefs\r\n        and abundant marine life, is Pulau Sulug; it offers a more tranquil and\r\n        deserted atmosphere.\r\n        Around Kota Kinabalu\r\n        From the bus station near Jalan Tun Razak, inexpensive\r\n        journeys can be made to locations not far from the city. One\r\n        interesting trip is to visit one of the many tamu (village markets)\r\n        held on different days of the week???ask about days at Kota Kinabalu?s\r\n        tourist information office. The best are at Tuaran 33 km (19 miles)\r\n        from KK, and farther north at Kota Belud, where one finds the\r\n        Mengkabong and Penambawan Bajau villages.\r\n        At Donggongon in the village of Kuai, some 10 km (6\r\n        miles)?south of KK on Penampang River, is the Kampung Monsopiad. It was\r\n        built to commemorate the legendary warrior Monsopiad, whose forte was\r\n        beheading his enemies. Forty-two of his ?trophies? are on show at the\r\n        Cultural Village.\r\n        Spectacular views of the nearby tropical jungle can be had\r\n        from a ride on the railway to Beaufort, 40 km (25 miles) northwest of\r\n        the town of Tenom. Just outside of Tenom is an Agricultural Research\r\n        Station. Although the train begins at Tanjung Aru, one way to save time\r\n        is to take a taxi to Beaufort and another from Tenom back to Kota\r\n        Kinabalu. At Beaufort, Chinese shophouses stand on stilts next to the\r\n        Padas River.\r\n        South from KK, heading towards the Crocker Mountain Range,\r\n        is the Rafflesia Centre. This is dedicated to the world?s largest\r\n        flower, the rafflesia, of which there are 14 varieties.\r\n        Mount Kinabalu National Park\r\n        The cool refreshing temperatures and spectacular scenery\r\n        make a journey to Mount Kinabalu Park worthwhile. Even if you are not\r\n        about to make the vigorous???though quite accessible???climb to the\r\n        mountain?s summit, the scenery, plants, and wildlife close to the\r\n        park?s headquarters are rewarding. Looming huge and dark in the light\r\n        of dawn, the peak is revealed in its full splendor. But it is often\r\n        hidden as morning clouds sweep upwards once again to shroud the peak in\r\n        mist.\r\n        At 4,100 m (13,450 ft), Gunung Kinabalu is the high peak\r\n        between the Himalayas and New Guinea. Its name means ?sacred home of\r\n        the dead? to the Kadazan who dwell on its lower slopes. The park can be\r\n        reached by road 90 km (56 miles) from Kota Kinubalu. There is a special\r\n        bus service from KK, but arrive early, as the bus will depart whenever\r\n        it becomes full. The trip to the park headquarters takes at least two\r\n        hours, though only one and a half hours on return. There are also\r\n        regular buses plying the highway between KK and Sandakan. The journey\r\n        from Kota Kinabalu to the park and climb up into the Crocker Range\r\n        takes you through Malaysia?s varieties of forest and landscape, from\r\n        coastal mangrove to cloud forest, montane, and subalpine meadow.\r\n        The park covers 754 sq km (291 sq miles) with temperatures\r\n        much, much cooler than on the coast. They ease to a gentle 20?C (68?F)\r\n        at park headquarters and drop to freezing point at the lodge where\r\n        climbers spend the night prior to their pre-dawn assault on the summit,\r\n        so warmer clothing is a must for park visitors???and rainproof\r\n        clothing, too, for those climbing the mountain.\r\n        The climb to the summit is largely open to anyone in good\r\n        condition and ready to make the effort. Except for extra-warm clothing\r\n        and good walking shoes, special mountain-climbing gear is not required.\r\n        But a majority of visitors???some 90 percent???are quite happy just\r\n        exploring the beautiful forests around the park headquarters. Those who\r\n        do climb to the summit are rewarded with a magnificent sunrise over\r\n        Borneo???and a certificate to prove it.\r\n        It is necessary to book at the Sabah National Park\r\n        Headquarters in Kota Kinabalu well in advance, especially in the months\r\n        of April, July, August, and December. The climb requires two days, with\r\n        an overnight stay at a chalet at the point where the climb begins. The\r\n        park offers a good restaurant and a wide range of accommodation, from\r\n        chalets to simple hostels. At the park?s headquarters arrangements are\r\n        made for your mountain guide, porters, and transport to the station\r\n        where the climb begins. There are multimedia and slide shows, and trail\r\n        maps are available for those who want to set out on their own (but be\r\n        careful, as some trails are not as well marked as others). Those with a\r\n        hardy constitution may like to swim in the cool Liwago River nearby. A\r\n        small but comprehensive Mountain Garden provides a good introduction to\r\n        the plant life you will find in Kinabalu?s forest.\r\n        Plant life. The pride of the mountain is its 1,500\r\n        different orchids, found up to an altitude of 3,800 m (12,464 ft).\r\n        Ferns are also present in their hundreds. Rhododendron-lovers may find\r\n        26 different varieties, together with 60 types of oak and chestnuts.\r\n        But the most fascinating remain the pink-speckled, carnivorous pitcher\r\n        plants. Look out, too, for the bracket fungus, growing out of tree\r\n        trunks to form a seat big and strong enough for child to sit on.\r\n        Wildlife. Many of the local forest?s 100 mammals are\r\n        difficult to spot???the few orang-utans, for instance, are practically\r\n        invisible, but you can at least hear the gibbons whooping. Besides the\r\n        usual sambar and mouse-deer, bearded pig, and clouded leopard, there\r\n        are 28 species of squirrel. They range from the black giant squirrel,\r\n        measuring up to 90 cm (close to 3 ft) from nose to tail and weighing in\r\n        at over 2 kg (41?2 lb), and the flying squirrel (who actually jumps\r\n        remarkably well) to the pygmy squirrel, 8 cm (3 in) long.\r\n        Children adore the tiny wide-eyed, doll-like slow\r\n        loris???slow because that is how he moves???and the tarsier. The\r\n        Kadazan describe the tarsier as some kind of compendium, with the ?tail\r\n        of a rat, eyes of an owl, feet of a frog, ears of a bat, nose of a\r\n        squirrel, fur of a loris, and torso of a monkey. ?\r\n        At night, street lamps around park headquarters attract\r\n        thousands of moths from the jungle. They make an ideal breakfast for\r\n        the birds in the next morning?s dawn, when all self-respecting\r\n        birdwatchers are up with their binoculars. Kinabalu has 250 species to\r\n        offer, including the scarlet sunbird, long-beaked spider-hunter,\r\n        fork-tailed grey drongo, crested serpent eagle, white-rumped shama, and\r\n        laughing thrushes.\r\n        Climbing Mount Kinabalu. Each year a marathon race???or\r\n        ?Climbathon????is held on the mountain, with the record presently held\r\n        by a British man, Ian Holmes, who ran to the summit in just 2 hours and\r\n        42.07 seconds. (The first ten place-getters in the 1998 event came in\r\n        under three hours. ) For ordinary mortals the climb takes two days.\r\n        (Meals and bedding are provided at the mountain lodges for the\r\n        overnight stop; also, note that rates charged by the park differ\r\n        between weekdays and the weekends). Armed with warm and rainproof\r\n        clothing for the mountain mists, pocket flashlight, and a stock of\r\n        bananas and chocolate for extra energy, you make an early morning\r\n        start. After a stretch of road, the climb proper begins at Timpohon\r\n        Gate. As you climb, you will notice the change from bamboo groves to\r\n        oaks (the forest here has 40 different varieties), myrtle, laurel, and\r\n        moss-covered pines. The trees become more gnarled and stunted as you\r\n        approach the barren granite plateau at the summit.\r\n        The first shelter at Carson?s Falls is at 1,951 m (6,400\r\n        ft). The best chance to see pitcher plants on the trail is at the\r\n        Second Shelter on the trail at 2,134 m (7,000 ft), but remember, no\r\n        picking. You make your overnight stop at the Laban Rata Resthouse, or\r\n        the Panar Laban Hut, Waras Hut, or Gunting Lagadan at 3,353 m (11,000\r\n        ft). Panar Laban means ?Place of Sacrifice,? for it is here that seven\r\n        white chickens and seven eggs are offered by Kadazan climbers to the\r\n        spirits of the sacred mountain each year.\r\n        To get to the summit at sunrise, you must get up at about\r\n        2am. You make your way up across a barren plateau of flaked and pitted\r\n        granite. The Sayat Sayat Huts, 3,811 m (12,500 ft), are the last\r\n        shelters before the summit. Directly to the north are the Donkey?s Ears\r\n        rocks, and behind them the Ugly Sisters, as you make your way west to\r\n        Low?s Peak (4,101 m/13,455 ft), the highest of the mountain?s nine\r\n        peaks. (British officer Hugh Low, a highly successful Resident in\r\n        Perak, reached the summit plateau in 1851. ) Even if the altitude does\r\n        not take your breath away, the view from the Crocker Range and out to\r\n        the Philippine Islands will. But one cannot loiter long on the summit,\r\n        as it will soon be enveloped in mid-morning mists, making the descent\r\n        treacherous for even the most experienced climber.\r\n        Poring Hot Springs\r\n        The Poring Hot Springs, 37 km (23 miles) from the park\r\n        headquarters, offers much relief to climbers after the surprisingly\r\n        tough climb down the mountain. The springs, with their soothing sulphur\r\n        baths, were developed by the Japanese during World War II. Cool off at\r\n        the Langanan Waterfall along one of trails, or at the Kepungit\r\n        Waterfall, a site rich in butterflies and bat-filled caves. Nearby are\r\n        groves of towering bamboo (poring means ?bamboo? in Kadazan). If it has\r\n        been raining, you might expect to find some leeches along the\r\n        trail.\r\n        Sandakan\r\n        Stretched along a narrow strip of land between steep hills\r\n        and the Sulu Sea, Sandakan is the gateway to the Turtle Islands\r\n        National Park, the Gomtanong Caves, and the Sepilok Orang-Utan\r\n        sanctuary. Once the capital of British North Borneo, modern Sandakan,\r\n        like Kota Kinabalu, was devastated by allied bombing and burnin g\r\n        during World War II, leaving little evidence of the former\r\n        township.\r\n        The lively Waterfront Market is a good starting point for\r\n\r\n        the visitor. Sandakan?s oldest temple, originally built in the 1880s,\r\n        is dedicated to the Goddess of Mercy, although modernization has\r\n        detracted from its character. The ornate Puu Jih Shih Buddhist Temple,\r\n        built at a cost of some US$2 million in 1987, stands on the hilltop\r\n        above Tanah Merah, south of Sandakan town. The temple is ablaze with\r\n        the red and gold of dragons, gilded Buddhas, hundreds of gleaming\r\n        lamps, and the fragrance of burning incense.\r\n        You can also tour the home of Agnes Keith, an American\r\n        writer whose life in Sandakan from 1932 to 1954, including experiences\r\n        in a prisoner-of-war camp, was documented in three novels, including\r\n        Land Below the Wind. Her pre-war home was destroyed but faithfully\r\n        reconstructed upon the return of her husband and herself in 1946.\r\n        Other links to the war years include the Australian\r\n        Memorial on the site of the former prisoner of war in Taman Rimba, off\r\n        Labuk Road, which commemorates the Allied soldiers who lost their lives\r\n        during the Japanese occupation and serves as a remembrance of the Death\r\n        March by 2,400 soldiers???mostly Australians???from the camp to Ranau\r\n        in September 1944. There is also a small Japanese cemetery in the\r\n        corner of the old cemetery on the hills overlooking the town.\r\n        The Kinabatangan River Basin\r\n        The Kinabatangan Basin, some 80 km (50 miles) southwest of\r\n        Sandakan, offers a good opportunity to catch sight of a range of\r\n        wildlife, especially hornbills, monitor lizards, macaques, and\r\n        orang-utans, not to mention the elusive proboscis monkey or the rare\r\n        rhinoceros and elephant. The Kinabatangan is a rewarding river for\r\n        wildlife enthusiasts, and trips can be organized with tour operators at\r\n        Sandakan.\r\n        Another access point to the wilds of Sabah is through the\r\n        Danum Valley Conservation Area. The valley is 80 km (50 miles)?inland\r\n        from Lahad Datu on Sabah?s east coast. Here are a range of walking\r\n        trails through the protected forests, home to the western tarsier,\r\n        orang-utan, leopard cat, deer, Malayan sun bear, smooth otter, and\r\n        others, including 16 varieties of bird life (three species of hornbill\r\n        alone).\r\n        The Sepilok Orang-Utan Sanctuary\r\n        A 30-minute drive west of Sandakan, this nature reserve\r\n        provides a rehabilitation center for young orang-utans, previously held\r\n        in captivity, to prepare them to be able to live in the forest unaided.\r\n        Boardwalk trails and muddy paths take visitors through the forest to\r\n        the feeding centers.\r\n        These highly theatrical russet-furred apes (see page 39)\r\n        exist at three levels in Sepilok?s rainforest: tame, entirely in the\r\n        care of the zoologists; semi-tame, living within reach of the\r\n        sanctuary?s feeding points; and wild, having moved off to the remote\r\n        parts of the forest away from their prying human cousins. Many of the\r\n        orang-utans are as curious as the visitors. They have flashy tastes,\r\n        preferring to snatch at bright objects rather than dull ones. They have\r\n        a good sense of parody. Watching someone put up an umbrella in the\r\n        rain, they will immediately mimic this, using leaves and twigs. And\r\n        they show a weary disdain for the antics of photographers leaping\r\n        around them.\r\n        Optimistic figures put the numbers of orang-utans at\r\n        between 10,000 and 20,000 in Sabah, mostly living in swampy forest\r\n        areas. While still free from being listed as endangered, fears are\r\n        nevertheless held that unbridled timber-cutting could sharply reduce\r\n        their numbers.\r\n        The Turtle Islands\r\n        From July to October, green and hawksbill turtles gather\r\n        to lay their eggs on the island beaches north of Sandakan Bay. The park\r\n        is 40 km (25 miles) from Sandakan and is comprised of three\r\n        islands???Pulau Selingaan, Pulau Bakkungan and Pulau Gulisaan???with a\r\n        total coverage of 1,740 hectares (4,295 acres). Pulau Selingaan has\r\n        three fully-furnished chalets where up to 20 people can stay, from\r\n        which you can maintain your overnight vigil (see page 101).\r\n        Singapore Stopover\r\n        Until the development of the new international airport in\r\n        KL, most people flew into or out of Singapore on their Malaysia trip,\r\n        staying over most notably for the duty-free shopping. Although\r\n        Singapore?s recent economic growth has led to higher prices, the\r\n        quality and variety of goods remain big draws. But shopping has been\r\n        superceded by travelers? interest in experiencing its cosmopolitan\r\n        lifestyle or its historical and cultural offerings. Two days are\r\n        required to do justice to the city???even on a short stay???but you\r\n        will find even more to explore than you can fit in.\r\n        The island of Singapore, joined by a causeway to Johor\r\n        Bahru at the southern tip of the Malaysian peninsula, covers 618 sq km\r\n        (238 sq miles), running 42 km (26 miles) from east to west at its\r\n        widest point and 23 km (141?2 miles) from north to south. An\r\n        independent republic since 1965 (see page 31), a third of the country\r\n        is a sprawling city dominated by skyscrapers, though with its patches\r\n        of green. The rest is tailored hills and fields, with the occasional\r\n        groves of lush green woodland, which just two centuries ago was the\r\n        hunting ground of tigers. Located just one degree???or 87 km (54\r\n        miles)???above the equator, Singapore?s humid heat???around 30?C (86?F)\r\n        by day, 23?C (73?F) at night???nurtures some of the world?s finest\r\n        orchids. Highly efficient air-conditioning makes life tolerable for\r\n        mere humans.\r\n        Land is still being reclaimed from the sea and coastal\r\n        swamp for the construction of industrial estates. Remaining true to its\r\n        colonial origins as a trading port, Singapore boasts the world?s\r\n        fourth-busiest port, as containers are brought from the region to be\r\n        reloaded for new destinations. Banking and stock trading have made\r\n        Singapore a key player in the international financial markets and a\r\n        prime location for raising capital. On top of this, its economy\r\n        sustains thriving machinery and sophisticated electronics industries.\r\n        Asia?s recent economic crisis has slowed things down, but international\r\n        demand for electronics promises to be a key to Singapore?s revival. Its\r\n        duty-free retail businesses, especially imported cameras, computers,\r\n        and jewelry, lead many to think of Singapore City as one giant shopping\r\n        mall (see page 151).\r\n        The causeway to Malaysia carries much of Singapore?s food\r\n        by road and rail as well as water by pipeline. But it continues to\r\n        strive for self-sufficiency where it can, and has become a strong\r\n        regional importer; Singaporeans? growing incomes allow them to demand a\r\n        wider choice of imported food.\r\n        Over three-quarters of the island?s population of 3.5\r\n        million are Chinese, 14% are Malay, and 7% Indian. The island boasts\r\n        some 500 Chinese and Hindu temples, Muslim mosques, Christian churches\r\n        for its Eurasians and Westerners, and even a couple of Jewish\r\n        synagogues. English, used without nationalistic inhibition, is the\r\n        lingua franca between communities???in addition to their Mandarin,\r\n        Malay, Tamil, and five other Indian dialects.\r\n        Singapore City\r\n        The ?Lion? or ?Garden City,? Singapore is easy to travel\r\n        in, thanks to modern transport systems including more than ten thousand\r\n        taxis, a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system, and a bus network. A good way\r\n        to get a feel for the city is to ride bus No. 124, which connects the\r\n        city?s major neighborhoods. The five main areas of the city worthy of\r\n        exploring are the Colonial District, Chinatown, Little India, the Arab\r\n        Quarter, the waterfront, and, of course, the city?s gardens.\r\n        The Colonial District\r\n        The Padang, bound by Connaught Drive and St. Andrews Road,\r\n        is the heart of what was once the center of colonial life and power in\r\n        Singapore. With the Singapore Cricket Club at one end of the carefully\r\n        manicured greens and the Singapore Recreation Club at the other,\r\n        stretching beyond and nearby are a host of sights that extend to the\r\n        famed Raffles Hotel, the War Memorial Park, Parliament House, the\r\n        Victoria Concert Hall and Theater, and the Neo-Classical design of the\r\n        Supreme Court. Within walking distance are several churches, and, just\r\n        beyond, museums, including the Asian Civilization Museum, the National\r\n        Museum, and the Singapore Art Museum.\r\n        The venerable National Museum, on Stamford Road just\r\n        across from the National Theatre, offers a splendid array of\r\n        predominantly Chinese cultural treasures???Sung, Yuan, and Ming\r\n        porcelain, a rich collection of jade, rosewood, and\r\n        mother-of-pearl-inlaid furniture, and gongs, drums, and silverware.\r\n        Attention is also given to Malaysian and Indonesian arts and a\r\n        documentation of the life of Sir Stamford Raffles. A series of\r\n        three-dimensional dioramas present the history of Singapore from its\r\n        earliest days as an ancient aboriginal settlement to its days as a\r\n        British trading port under Japanese occupation and the post-war\r\n        campaign for independence.\r\n        A block away from Waterloo Street, at the junction of\r\n        Rochor Road and Victoria Street, is Bugis Village, well known for its\r\n        restaurants and entertainment, though less rowdy than in days gone\r\n        by.\r\n        Chinatown\r\n        What was once the heart of Singapore?s Chinese community\r\n        is now being encroached upon by new development, as the rising\r\n        skyscrapers of the financial district cast their ever-widening shadows\r\n        on the shophouses of South Bridge Road. More recently, efforts have\r\n        been made at restoration rather than destruction, but the old groceries\r\n        and apothecaries are still threatened by rising rents. But not all is\r\n        lost???yet. You can wander around stalls of live eels, gnarled ginger\r\n        root, decorated lanterns, and freshly slaughtered python meat.\r\n        Chinese temples abound. Among the most well known is Leon\r\n        San See Temple, on Race Course Road, dedicated to the goddess of mercy,\r\n        Kuan Yin. The Thain Hock Keng Temple, on Telok Ayer Street, dates back\r\n        to 1821 when a house on the site was dedicated to the goddess of the\r\n        sea; the temple?s construction was begun in 1839.\r\n        The most famous shrine is the Sri Mariamman, the oldest\r\n        Hindu temple on the island, practically founded with Singapore itself\r\n        in the early 19th century. Inside its South Indian gopuram (tower)\r\n        profusely decorated with statues, you will find the temple?s presiding\r\n        goddess. She won allegiance for her cures for the smallpox and cholera\r\n        that were prevalent when the colony was established. Next door is the\r\n        Chulia Mosque.\r\n        Little India\r\n        Little India is centered around Serangoon Road, and\r\n        besides the myriad shops and loud music, you will also find restaurants\r\n        and temples. One of the most interesting is the Sri Veeramakaliamman\r\n        Temple, dedicated to Kali, whose origins go back to the early 1880s,\r\n        though the roof carvings of the goddess?s many manifestations have only\r\n        been in place for three decades. Worship here tends to be noisy and\r\n        theatrical.\r\n        The Thandayuthapani Temple on Tank Road is scene for the\r\n        annual Thaipusam Festival that is marked throughout the peninsula by\r\n        Hindu communities, as devotees express their faith by piercing their\r\n        bodies with metal spikes.\r\n        The Arab Quarter\r\n        Singapore?s Muslims are a rich mixture of Malays and\r\n        Indians who intermarried with 19th-century Arab traders. Their\r\n        neighborhood, specifically North Bridge Road, has much of the\r\n        atmosphere of a Middle-Eastern bazaar, with aromas very different than\r\n        in Chinatown. Shops selling silks, Indonesian batiks, basketware, and\r\n        jewelry nestle around the minarets and domes of the Sultan Mosque, on\r\n        North Bridge Road near Arab Street. In the cool, carpeted interior of\r\n        Singapore?s largest mosque, the clock gives the time in Mecca.\r\n        Up Arab Street across Canal Road?s waterway, one plunges\r\n        into a maze of stalls on Sungei Kelantan and Larut roads, known as\r\n        Thieves? Market, open only in the afternoon. Hardware and antiques,\r\n        both stolen and acquired honestly, are its speciality, but also to be\r\n        found are jewelry and fake designer clothes. Beware of pick-pockets as\r\n        you shop.\r\n        The Waterfront\r\n        Land reclamation on the downtown stretch of the Singapore\r\n        River has moved the colorful junks, sampan riverboats, and tongkang\r\n        lighters west to the wharves at Pasir Panjang Road. The Statue of\r\n        Merlion, half fish, half-lion, still guards the estuary, and lovers\r\n        meet on the benches of Merlion Park. But it is the great Harbor that\r\n        now provides the waterfront?s visual excitement. Beyond the park, the\r\n        Elizabeth Walk Promenade is a good spot from which to watch the\r\n        action.\r\n        For a close-up view, take a harbor cruise in a motorized\r\n        junk from Clifford Pier or the new passenger terminal at Jardine Steps.\r\n        Your vessel coasts by freighters unloading cargo at the wharves and\r\n        fights its way through the countless scows, water-taxis, police-boats,\r\n        tugs, schooners, yachts, and the supertankers that supply Singapore?s\r\n        half-dozen oil refineries.\r\n        Busy Clifford Pier stands at the end of the Change Alley,\r\n        a partly elevated shopping corridor where money and goods change hands\r\n        at lightning speed.\r\n        Gardens\r\n        To compensate for the relentless urban and industrial\r\n        construction, Singapore has covered its island with parks and gardens.\r\n        The origins of the Botanic Gardens, on Holland Road, date as far back\r\n        as 1836, when a voluntary society hoped to build on earlier failed\r\n        attempts at establishing a garden. It was not until 1859 that they\r\n        succeeded, originally as a nursery for the Brazilian seedlings that\r\n        launched Malaysia?s rubber industry (see page 27). Two aging trees here\r\n        were actually bore witness to this historic event. More aesthetically\r\n        pleasing is the superb orchid collection. Look out, too, for the fine\r\n        collection of palms, the cannonball tree, the sausage tree, and the\r\n        swans on a lily-covered lake.\r\n        Jurong Park on Yuan Ching Road offers an exquisite\r\n        juxtaposition of Japanese and Chinese garden design. The tranquil\r\n        Seiwaen (Japanese Gardens) present a harmonious landscape of rock\r\n        gardens, bridges, and carp pools. The more ebullient Yu Hwa Yuan\r\n        (Chinese Gardens) are inspired by those of the Peking Summer Palace.\r\n        Climb the six-tiered Cloud-Piercing Pagoda and look out over the red\r\n        and yellow pavilions, the Moon-Receiving Tower, the Fragrance-Filled\r\n        Lily Pond, and the Jade-Splashed Bridge.\r\n        After this, the Tiger Balm Gardens 10 km (6 miles) west of\r\n        Singapore City on Pasir Pajang Road stand in stark contrast, but offer\r\n        a Chinese theme park that children will adore. Also good for the\r\n        younger set are the child-friendly Zoological Gardens in the northern\r\n        part of the island on Mandai Lake Road, which include a thriving\r\n        orang-utan colony. And nearby is the The Night Safari, open only from\r\n        7:30pm to midnight, where you can see nocturnal animals on a guided\r\n        tour by rail cart.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n
