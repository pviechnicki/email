Early reports indicate the man, identified as Ahmed Mustafa, was\r\nderanged. Some Israelis blame Jordan's King Hussein for inciting the attack by\r\nreleasing a vitriolic letter that accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\r\nNetanyahu of provoking Palestinian violence. Conversely, some Palestinians\r\nblame Israel for escalating tensions in the region by expanding Jewish housing\r\nin East Jerusalem and failing to relinquish enough of the West Bank. The\r\nmassacre prompted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to speak to Netanyahu after\r\nhaving refused his phone calls for days. (3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Albania is imploding . (Primer: It's between Italy and Greece.) Nine\r\npyramid investment schemes collapsed, which wiped out the life savings of\r\nthousands of Albanians, which led to protests, which led to rebellion, which\r\nled to police giving loyalist civilians assault weapons, which led to gunfire,\r\nlooting, and roving bands of robbers. Inmates are escaping from jails, and the\r\npresident has lost control of the army. There is talk of importing a\r\npeacekeeping force, ? la Yugoslavia, but no talk of U.S. soldiers. \"Albanians\r\nthemselves were unsure whether to call the violence a civil war, a revolution,\r\na popular uprising or just plain chaos,\" said the New \r\n               York\r\n\r\n               Times . (3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            A\r\nsuspect has been charged with the murder of Ennis Cosby . A $100,000\r\nreward offered by the National \r\n               Enquirer led to a tip, which led\r\npolice to the gun and the killer's cap, which led to the arrest of Mikail\r\nMarkhasev, an 18-year-old Russian ?migr? with a criminal background. Markhasev\r\nalso matches the description provided by the woman who allegedly saw the\r\ngunman. Early reports linked Markhasev to a Russian car-theft ring, but police\r\nnow say the killing looks like a random robbery attempt gone awry.\r\n(3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               TCI , the country's biggest cable-TV company, plans to raise its rates\r\nby 7 percent . This comes after TCI recently hiked its rates by 13 percent.\r\nCritics say the price increase proves 1) last year's telecommunications bill\r\nfailed to keep cable rates down as promised, and 2) competition from\r\nsatellite-dish TV services isn't deterring rate hikes either. Other cable\r\ncompanies are expected to follow suit if TCI gets away with the rate increase.\r\n(3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The\r\nanti-anti-cloning backlash is underway. At a Senate hearing, Republican\r\nsenators worried that a ban on human-cloning research might prevent lifesaving\r\nmedical breakthroughs, and researchers and ethicists said there is no need to\r\nlegislate hastily, since it will take a while to refine the sheep-cloning\r\ntechnique to work in humans. This comes after President Clinton banned federal\r\nfunding of human-cloning research and two lawmakers filed bills to ban human\r\ncloning. The Sunday Times of London reported that a Belgian scientist\r\nhad cloned a human, but the report was soon debunked when the scientist\r\nexplained that he had merely fertilized an egg in vitro and then caused it to\r\nsplit, producing twins. Meanwhile, an elderly Milwaukee couple are soliciting\r\nwomen to conceive and bear their grandchild, using frozen sperm from their dead\r\nson. (3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The\r\nTWA Flight 800 missile theory is back. A group headed by former ABC\r\nnewsman Pierre Salinger published a massive report in Paris \r\n               Match\r\nclaiming that a U.S. Navy missile blew up the plane. The key evidence cited in\r\nthe report: 1) a red residue on the plane's seats showing \"chemical elements\r\nconsistent with solid missile fuel\" and 2) a government radar tape showing a\r\nfast projectile on a collision course with the plane. Federal investigators\r\nsaid that lab tests show the residue is from standard glue used in plane seats.\r\nThey also seized the radar tape, examined it, and said it shows no missile. The\r\nWashington \r\n               Post groaned that the TWA mystery \"has become the\r\naviation equivalent of the Kennedy assassination\"--i.e., no amount of disproof\r\nsatisfies the conspiracy theorists. (3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Update on the Democratic fund-raising scandal : 1) President\r\nClinton said FBI agents denied him advance warning about Chinese\r\ninfluence-buying efforts by telling his aides to keep the information secret.\r\nThe FBI then issued a statement contradicting Clinton. Pundits oohed and aahed\r\nover the quarrel. The next day everyone insisted it was just a\r\nmisunderstanding. Attorney General Janet Reno said she tried to tell National\r\nSecurity Adviser Tony Lake about the Chinese scheme 10 months ago but was\r\nunable to reach him by phone, so she asked the FBI to tell the White House,\r\nwhich led to the above fiasco. 2) The FBI warned six members of Congress last\r\nyear that China had targeted them for illegal campaign donations through\r\nforeign companies. 3) The New York Times reported that the\r\nadministration endorsed a project in China that was financially important to\r\nthe Riady family just after a Riady-controlled company put Webster Hubbell on\r\nits payroll. White House special counsel Lanny Davis said Clinton may have\r\nknown three years ago that his friends were subsidizing Hubbell.\r\n(3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Playboy says it has corroborated a report that Timothy McVeigh\r\nconfessed to the Oklahoma City bombing. The magazine claims its article is\r\nbased on documents \"prepared under the direction\" of McVeigh's lawyer, but that\r\nthese documents are different from those previously cited by the Dallas\r\n\r\n               Morning \r\n               News . According to the article, McVeigh said he alone\r\ndrove the truck bomb to the site--but he flunked polygraph tests, and his\r\nlawyers were skeptical. The New York Times reports that \"details in the\r\narticle contradict physical evidence already presented in open court.\"\r\n(3/14)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               Five\r\nfemale soldiers say Army investigators pressured them to falsely\r\naccuse their superiors of rape. Four of the five say they had sex with\r\ntheir instructors, but that it was consensual. The women claim they were\r\npromised helpful transfers if they told investigators what they wanted to hear\r\nand threatened with retaliation if they didn't. The announcement was organized\r\nby the NAACP, which suspects racism in the investigation because all the\r\naccused officers are black, and most of the accusers, white. (3/12)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Political fallout from the scandal: 1) The Senate expanded its\r\ninvestigation to include \"improper\" as well as illegal conduct in the 1996\r\nelections. This brings soft money and other much-criticized practices under\r\nscrutiny. It is seen as a rebuke to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and a\r\nvictory for Democrats, Sen. Fred Thompson (who will chair the investigation),\r\nand campaign reform. 2) Clinton's job rating fell from 60 to 55 points in a\r\nWashington Post poll, apparently because pollees disapproved of his use\r\nof the White House for fund raising. (3/12)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Republican fund-raising hypocrisy watch: 1) The Washington\r\n\r\n               Post reported that a Republican House committee counsel hit up\r\ninvestment firms for $100,000 contributions to the GOP shortly after working on\r\nfinancial-deregulation legislation. 2) Democrats released documents indicating\r\nthat Republicans sold big political donors meals with the party's leaders in\r\nfederal buildings in 1995. 3) The Washington \r\n               Post reported that\r\nfor $5,000, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is offering donors a\r\nchance to give Trent Lott and other senators \"advice\" at a forum next month.\r\n(3/12)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Germany\r\ntold the United States it would expel an American spy . Initial reports\r\nindicated the Germans were angry because the agent was conducting economic\r\nespionage against Germany. But U.S. officials now say that the agent was\r\ngathering intelligence on another country--most likely Iran--and that the\r\nGermans ordered the diplomat out because they're tired of the United States\r\nusing their country as a spy nest and keeping them in the dark about it.\r\nAmerican officials are asking Germany to let the agent stay. (3/12)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Russian\r\nPresident Boris Yeltsin ordered a shake-up of his Cabinet. Yeltsin\r\npledged to keep only two aides: Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Deputy\r\nPrime Minister Anatoly Chubais. The betting is that Chubais, a free-market\r\nadvocate whom Yeltsin promoted just last week, can now put allies in key jobs\r\nand restart economic reforms. The Washington \r\n               Post declared that\r\nYeltsin is back in the saddle and is launching a much-needed second wave of\r\neconomic reform. But the Chicago \r\n               Tribune warned that Chubais will\r\nfail, because he is a lousy manager and everyone in Russia hates him.\r\n(3/12)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Gangsta\r\nrap artist Christopher Wallace, a k a Notorious B.I.G. , was assassinated\r\nin an apparent drive-by shooting. Police have no leads, but everyone suspects\r\nthe shooting is a payback for last year's drive-by assassination of rival\r\nrapper Tupac Shakur. Wallace, who represented the East Coast rap community, had\r\na long-running feud with Shakur, who represented the West Coast rap community.\r\nPolice fear an escalating war between the two sides. (3/10)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            President Clinton ordered\r\nfederal agencies to hire welfare recipients . The idea is to set an\r\nexample for business leaders. The announcement appeased some critics who have\r\naccused Clinton of hypocrisy for failing (until now) to take this step. But\r\nskeptics pointed out that there are few openings for low-skilled workers (since\r\nthe government is shrinking), and unions objected to giving welfare recipients\r\npreference in the competition for those openings.
