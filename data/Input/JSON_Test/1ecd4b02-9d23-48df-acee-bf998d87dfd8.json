She is writing a novel about how\r\ndivorce affects children. She writes a weekly column for the Ottawa\r\nCitizen.\r\n\r\n            Such is the rhythm of our legal system: Something quite\r\nsimple (\"I want a divorce\") is made exceedingly complex (\"What percentage of\r\nyour income goes to the phone bills?\") only to be made too simple again\r\n(\"Father gets Easter; Mother, Thanksgiving.\")\r\n\r\n            One learns this phenomenon within minutes of entering\r\nlaw school. Simple facts (\"Angus refused to sing 'In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida' at the\r\nGoldstein bar mitzvah\") generate pages of abstract legal theory (\"Was there a\r\nmeeting of the minds about whose version he was to sing?\"). Your job as law\r\nstudent is to distill all this down to a two-paragraph summary in case you are\r\ncalled upon in class. You will later boil it down to a one-sentence summary for\r\nan outline you'll use to study for finals. The point may or may not appear in\r\nthe exam.\r\n\r\n            Such expansion and contraction mean that lawyers are\r\nnever quite certain how big or important things are. This is why we yell about\r\npaperclips and sleep through death-penalty cases.\r\n\r\n            The Microsoft trial has been called the antitrust trial\r\nof the latter half of this century. As have the last three antitrust trials\r\nthis century. It began as a few disputed sentences in a 1994 consent decree\r\nlimiting some alleged anti-competitive jiggery-pokery by Microsoft. The\r\n\"six-to-eight-week trial\" metastasized into a 76-day ordeal spanning 11 months\r\nwith dozens of witnesses and thousands of exhibits. It might have grown even\r\nbigger, but Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson deliberately limited\r\nthe number of witnesses and kinds of testimony to prevent the legal entropy\r\nthat produces an O.J. trial.\r\n\r\n            When testimony ended last June, it looked for a moment\r\nas though Computing as We Know It was on the line. But things got quiet, we\r\ntried instant messaging, we maybe upgraded, and we bought orange Gap vests\r\nonline.\r\n\r\n            Bill Gates gave money away.\r\n\r\n            Through August and September the case contracted even\r\nmore, with each side submitting proposed findings of fact, then revised\r\nversions of same, each of which told a condensed version of their story from\r\ntrial. The government said Microsoft used its monopoly power in the operating\r\nsystems market to bully and threaten its way into dominance over the browser\r\nmarket. Microsoft argued that it acted competitively in a competitive market,\r\nthat distribution channels for competitors were never foreclosed, and that\r\nconsumers have not been harmed.\r\n\r\n            \"More paperclips!\"\r\n\r\n            Today, with two and a half hours allocated to each side\r\nfor closing arguments, the case contracts once again until it is virtually\r\ndancing on the head of the pin. Except for the venue--proceedings moved\r\nupstairs to a vast courtroom in the U.S. District Courthouse where we sit under\r\nthe watchful statue eyes of Moses, Justinian, Hammurabi, and Solon--little has\r\nchanged. Except the lawyers have traded their fine brushes for broad\r\nones--paint rollers, perhaps--and the Microsoft case appears even smaller than\r\nit did before.\r\n\r\n            The Justice Department's outside counsel David Boies,\r\nwho cross-examined some of Microsoft's star witnesses into sweaty little\r\nribbons at trial, simply hands out his outline to the class. He spends the\r\nmorning walking us through the elements of antitrust law and offering evidence\r\nfrom the record to support his claims. This man who virtually commanded the\r\nsmall courtroom downstairs during trial, seems somewhat diminished today. But\r\nhe makes his points: Microsoft has monopoly power for operating systems;\r\nMicrosoft maintained its operating system monopoly through anti-competitive\r\npractices; Microsoft used that monopoly to try to monopolize the browser\r\nmarket; Microsoft engaged in contracts and conspiracies in restraint of\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n            Microsoft's John Warden takes a different tack.\r\nSpeaking as though his mouth is full of aquarium gravel, he paints everything\r\nlarger than it is. His job is simple: He must punch holes into the government's\r\nsoft places. He does not use an outline. He simply begins to roar. The\r\ngovernment has never, ever proved that their browser and operating systems are\r\nseparable. (Whether they were designed to be\r\ninseparable he leaves for another day). In swinging away at the government's\r\nweak spots (market definition, harm to consumer, Netscape's market\r\npenetration), Warden employs the kind of hyperbole usually reserved for\r\ndomestic fights about who does the dishes. \"The government has offered\r\nno evidence\"; \"Professor Fisher offered\r\nno analysis\"; \"Microsoft has never induced an OEM to drop their competitors' products.\"\r\n\r\n            (\"But Mr. Warden, we saw the contracts ...\")\r\n\r\n            \"Never!\" he roars. \"Baloney,\" he sputters. At some\r\npoint he coughs so hard that someone at the DOJ table hands him a cough drop.\r\n\"Games and shams,\" he snarls. When he concludes, it is with an ominous\r\nreference to central planning. As Boies rises for his half-hour rebuttal, you\r\ncan almost hear the drumbeats from Red Square.\r\n\r\n            David Boies immediately agrees. Central planning is\r\nbad. The balalaikas recede. Then he whips out his outline. He focuses narrowly,\r\nperhaps too much so: The consumer has been harmed; Microsoft did what they did\r\nnot to sell more copies of Windows, but rather, to stop their competitors. Now\r\nwe are all dancing on the head of a pin.\r\n\r\n            The trial ends without fanfare. Judge Jackson pounds\r\nhis gavel and leaves the massive courtroom. Now he will reduce these thousands\r\nof facts to an even smaller opinion. In the interim, technologies will change\r\nand change again. When the dust settles, if it ever settles, all of this will\r\nstand for something very great in the casebooks and the exam papers.\r\n\r\n            Unless it stands for something very small.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               \r\n                  Click\r\nhere  for dispatches from the last session of the\r\nMicrosoft trial between October 1998 and February 1999.\r\n
