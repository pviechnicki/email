(The\r\nWashington Post , which usually plays up\r\nCapitol Hill intrigue, reefers this story.) The GOP's response to George W.\r\nBush's criticisms of it on Tuesday is the lead at USA Today and the top non-local story at the Post . The Los Angeles\r\nTimes leads with the National Football League's decision to pass over\r\nthe City of Angels and put an expansion team in Houston instead. (This story is\r\nput above the fold by USAT and reefered by the\r\nNYT and Post .) A\r\nHouston billionaire offered over $700 million for the team--the highest price\r\never paid for a pro sports franchise--plus a publicly financed, $300 million\r\nglass-walled stadium with a retractable roof.\r\n\r\n            The $50 billion (over 10 years) health-insurance bill\r\nwould, among other things, a) accelerate the 100 percent tax deduction for the\r\nself-employed, b) expand the availability of tax-free accounts for medical\r\npayments, and c) create tax deductions for long-term-care insurance. The\r\nDemocrats said the bill would help only 1 percent of the population, and\r\nPresident Clinton threatened to veto it in its present form. But the main event\r\nis today, when the House votes on competing \"patient rights\" bills, which would\r\nallow customers to sue their HMOs. (On Tuesday, the House leadership for the\r\nfirst time threw its weight behind a limited right to sue--see yesterday's TP for\r\ndetails.)\r\n\r\n            All the papers, save the LAT , run follow-ups to George W. Bush's rebuke of congressional\r\nRepublicans on Tuesday. Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, and some Hill Republicans\r\naccused Bush of abandoning the GOP rank and file, and Bush backtracked\r\nslightly, stressing that the GOP's image as heartless was a Democratic\r\ncaricature, not reality. USAT calls the GOP\r\nresponse a \"backlash\" against Bush, but the other papers are more favorable to\r\nhim. The NYT story stresses the inability of\r\ncongressional Republicans to soften their image post-Newt Gingrich; the\r\nPost notes that Bush's policy positions are\r\nstill solidly conservative, despite Bauer's and Forbes' assertions to the\r\ncontrary; and the Journal calls Bush's Tuesday\r\nremarks his \"Sister Souljah moment\"--referring to candidate Clinton's\r\nsuccessful 1992 strategy of distancing himself from his party's ideological\r\nbase. (For Ballot Box's take on the Bush-GOP brouhaha, click here.)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The LAT fronts the FBI's\r\ndisclosure that the computer networks of the Pentagon, Energy Department, NASA,\r\nand of defense contractors have undergone a year of extensive, coordinated\r\ncyberattacks from overseas computers--some from Moscow. The hackers have stolen\r\nunclassified but sensitive information on weapons research. One thing holding\r\nup effective countermeasures, the Post writes, is a culture clash between low-tech\r\nFBI agents and the geeky computer consultants helping them with encryption.\r\n\r\n            Following up on a Journal\r\nstory yesterday, the NYT reports that a diet pill company is using a\r\nWeb\r\nsite to broadcast an ABC News interview of its chief executive\r\nbefore ABC has aired the program in which the\r\ninterview will be used. (Companies often make their own tapes of their\r\ninterviews with the press.) Metabolife International Inc. says that after\r\ndiscovering the Web site of ABC interviewer Arnold Diaz (titled \"Schemes, Scams, and Savin' a Buck\"), it began\r\nto suspect that ABC's report will be unfair to its product, so it released the\r\nentire interview on the Internet as part of a counteroffensive. Today's Papers\r\nenvisions a world in which every interview subject is his own media watchdog;\r\nwhen a reporter quotes him out of context, the subject need not beg an editor\r\nor producer for space or time to respond--he can simply publish the unedited\r\ninterview himself.\r\n\r\n            The Journal notes the\r\ndemise of a hallowed cultural institution: the wedding-night consummation.\r\nThese days, half of all couples live together before marriage, and less than\r\none-fifth are virgins on their wedding night. As a result, many\r\nnewlyweds--one-third of 18-to-24-year-olds and half of those over 40--would\r\nrather spend their wedding night engaged in non-connubial activities like\r\npartying with wedding guests visiting from afar. \"Sex, when it happens\" for\r\nnewlyweds, reports the Journal , \"is often an\r\napostrophe, not an exclamation point.\"\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
