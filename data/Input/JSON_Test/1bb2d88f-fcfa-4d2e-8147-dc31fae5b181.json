Telling the story of a myopic adolescent girl\r\nwho's persecuted by her peers and slighted by her suburban family (which\r\nreveres her pretty little sister, a goody-two-shoes in a tutu), Solondz\r\nprolonged his heroine's humiliations until I wanted to scream, \"I GET IT\r\nALREADY!\" He was a maestro, all right, but of the sadistic kind, and the\r\nmovie's laughs didn't leaven its punishingly untranscendent misery--they\r\ncondensed it. This was the world as seen through glasses so thick they barely\r\nlet in light.\r\n\r\n            Solondz's\r\nnew foray into misery, Happiness , lays it on even thicker. This time,\r\nhowever, he spreads the pain around, and he brings in sundry instruments to\r\nshare in the playing of his lone theme. The upshot defies categorization.\r\nHappiness is an aching roundelay, a triumphantly benumbed ensemble farce\r\nthat mingles condescension and compassion in a manner that's disarmingly--and\r\noften upsettingly--original.\r\n\r\n            Before I go any further: You should know that I have\r\ncollaborated with the co-producer of Happiness , Christine Vachon, on a\r\nnew book called Shooting to Kill , which may be ordered by clicking here.\r\n(Just kidding. Wait a minute, I'm not kidding. Click here before you do anything else.) I was around for\r\npre-production and made a few casting suggestions (politely ignored), went on a\r\nstupefyingly dull \"tech scout\" with the director and key crew, watched some\r\nscenes being shot, and got steady gossip from Christine that I can't share with\r\nyou although I might if you e-mail me proof that you've bought the book. I\r\nthought about recusing myself, but I have no direct financial ties to the\r\npicture and think it's one of the most interesting of the year. Why should I\r\ndeprive myself?\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Happiness revolves around three sisters who live some distance from a\r\nlarge metropolis, but the relationship to Chekhov ends there. The place is\r\nsuburban New Jersey. Sweet, tremulous Joy Jordan (Jane Adams), the youngest,\r\nhas turned 30 and still lives in the house of her parents, Mona (Louise Lasser)\r\nand Lenny (Ben Gazzara), who have a condo in Florida and are in the throes of a\r\nvexingly tentative separation. Middle sister Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) is the\r\nauthor of arty, titillating short stories and a magnet for studs and weight\r\nlifters; she resides in a dim high-rise down the corridor from two unrelated\r\nfatties, Kristina (Camryn Manheim) and Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman). The\r\nlatter, a compulsive obscene phone caller who longs for his sleek, chic\r\nneighbor, is the psychiatric patient of Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker), who\r\nhappens to be the husband of Helen's older sister, chipper Trish (Cynthia\r\nStevenson)--and also a pedophile who, in the course of the film, drugs little\r\nboys and has (off camera) sex with them.\r\n\r\n            \r\nPedophilia, rape, murder, suicide,\r\ndismemberment, obscene talk: Happiness is about the sense of\r\nincompleteness that these seemingly disparate people carry inside them--and,\r\nmore important, the ways in which their prodigious longings manifest themselves\r\nin their sexual predilections. And yet these kindred spirits almost never\r\nacknowledge a connection. Their similarities don't mitigate their aloneness,\r\nand talking about their problems doesn't help much, either. It's no accident\r\nthat Solondz's pedophile protagonist is a shrink and that the characters who\r\nget things off their chests go ahead and act on them anyway. There's no such\r\nthing as catharsis: Come once, you'll want to come again and again and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n            The\r\npre-title sequence sets the drolly excruciating tone. Joy has just told Andy\r\n(Jon Lovitz) that she thinks they should stop seeing each other. Solondz goes\r\nso tight on Lovitz's ample flesh that he could sweat off the screen and onto\r\nyour lap. But as his strangled monosyllables give way to lavish verbal abuse\r\nthe shots go wider, so that we take in the romantic restaurant awash in fake\r\nplants and frippery--a setting that mocks this unhappy couple the way the\r\nmovie's very title hangs over it like a mushroom cloud. Solondz keeps\r\nHappiness right on the border between irony and empathy. The gags are\r\noften easy, but the characters are in an authentic hell. And there isn't a\r\ntrace of irony in the skinny, frazzled Adams, who's as raw as a newly birthed\r\ngazelle. Some directors know how to exploit their actors' vulnerabilities, and\r\nSolondz seems to have scraped off layers of his leading lady's skin--it's so\r\ntranslucent you can almost read her organs.\r\n\r\n            At the other extreme, Hoffman, as one of the two fat\r\nneighbors, is encased in his flab like a tortured prisoner of war. His doleful\r\nlow tones and operatic mouth-breathing give even his vilest lines a dopey\r\nsweetness. In fact, Solondz compels us to collude with even his most unsavory\r\ncharacters. Baker's pedophile is so furtive that he's almost immobile, but we\r\nregister the darting eyes under the bland, Mr. Rodgers-like fa?ade, and as he\r\nwaits for a little boy to eat a drugged tuna sandwich, we hold our breaths the\r\nway we did in Psycho when Norman Bates watched the car with the body of\r\nMarian Crane almost not sink into the swamp. The only character whose pain we\r\ndon't feel is also the only \"normal\" one, Stevenson's Trish--a sugary,\r\npassive-aggressive gargoyle who embodies everything that made some of us flee\r\nthe suburbs for the urban jungle.\r\n\r\n            Not all of\r\nHappiness is as consistently inspired. The scenes of Joy at work\r\n(wanting to do good, she crosses a picket line to take a job teaching English\r\nas a second language) are coarsely conceived, and the parents, Mona and Lenny,\r\ndon't exist on the same level as the other characters. Boyle's Helen is a thin\r\ndirty joke rescued only by a good punch line (and Boyle, who drops her voice to\r\na husky whisper, looks wildly out of place in this clearly Jewish family). But\r\nsome of the one-joke roles turn out to have more under the surface than is at\r\nfirst apparent. In one scene, fat Kristina tells Allen about a horrible deed\r\nshe has committed and, while her listener attempts to process it, appalled,\r\ntucks into an ice cream sundae. That might have been the cheapest kind of fat\r\ngag, but because of the way it's shot and acted, our responses don't end with a\r\nsnicker. We can see that Kristina is living a life of nightmarish deprivation,\r\nand getting the only kind of pleasure that she knows.\r\n\r\n            \r\nJohn Waters once said that he would like to\r\nmake a film that received an X or NC-17 rating with no foul language or\r\ngenitalia--\"it would just be so offensive to people's values.\" Happiness\r\ncertainly has foul language, as well as a (brief) shot of Joy's uncovered\r\nbreasts, but what's truly shocking is its unblinking gaze--hard and clinical\r\nbut also nonjudgmental. Scenes in which Maplewood's son (Rufus Read) asks his\r\ndad about masturbation come close to being healthy . But the context is\r\ntoo spooky, and the conversations creep into the red zone when the father\r\noffers to demonstrate his technique.\r\n\r\n            Solondz's writing doesn't\r\ncut very deep, but it does swing wide, smashing taboos on all sides--the film\r\nis the dark side of There's Something About Mary . And in some ways, it\r\ncouldn't have had a more fitting launch. At the same time that the picture was\r\nwinning an international critics' prize at the Cannes Film Festival (where it\r\nwas shown outside the main competition), Universal, the studio that financed it\r\n(through its recently acquired \"indie\" wing, October), unloaded it in a\r\npanic--largely because its new owners, the Bronfmans of Seagram, feared being\r\nassociated with a movie that featured a pedophile. That the booze-peddling\r\nBronfmans wanted nothing to do with a film that functions as the opposite of an\r\nintoxicant is the kind of irony with which Happiness teems.\r\n\r\n            October did choose to\r\nrelease The Celebration , a Danish dysfunctional family drama that treats\r\nmatters of incest and perversion with a tad more taste. Children, siblings,\r\nnieces, and nephews all gather at a prosperous estate to celebrate the\r\n60 th birthday of its formidable patriarch (Henning Moritzen), who\r\nturns out to have had monstrous designs on two of his own children. You've seen\r\nthis sort of picture before: People get drunk and drag skeletons out of\r\nclosets, and the tension between the formal dinner party rituals and the truths\r\nthat simmer beneath the surface give way to a Walpurgisnacht . The\r\nanti-patriarchal content is fairly routine, but you should see the movie anyway\r\nbecause the director, Thomas Vinterberg, is a great, hypersensitive filmmaker\r\nwhose edgy, grainy, caught-on-the-fly camerawork seems to make the very\r\ncelluloid shiver with rage.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
