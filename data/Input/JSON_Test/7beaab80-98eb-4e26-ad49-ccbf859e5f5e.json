Between the Amtrak ride to and from the city--Amtrak out West might\r\nbe nice, but on the East Coast it's hell--and the awful fluorescent lights in\r\nthe Time Inc. building, where Fortune is headquartered, I was a pretty\r\ncranky guy yesterday. My mood is much improved today, back in my lovely little\r\noffice overlooking this lovely little downtown, reading about the Red Sox\r\nvictory last night--rooting for the Red Sox is the curse of all native New\r\nEnglanders--perusing the New York Times before I saddle up for a day in\r\nfront of my computer. I check my e-mail, and there is your latest\r\nmissive--sent, it says, at 5:30 a.m.! I'm happy to get it--though momentarily\r\nworried that you're not getting enough sleep on what is supposed to be, after\r\nall, a short vacation for you. In any case, yesterday I didn't think I could\r\nmuster another thought about the Internet if you put a gun to my head. But as I\r\nsay, today I've got a whole new outlook.\r\n\r\n            The distinction I was trying to make yesterday was between the Internet as a\r\ntool to make the world a better place (which I don't buy) and the Internet as a\r\npowerful business tool (which I very much do buy). And so there is not that\r\nmuch in your message that I disagree with, because you are focusing on the\r\nbusiness dynamics. Where we do differ, clearly, is our level of enthusiasm for\r\nthe coming of interactivity. You're right: I roll my eyes at the thought of an\r\n\"Internet refrigerator.\" I'm not all that sure I'd even want to have a Web site\r\ndedicated to me and my needs--which are pretty mundane and pretty well\r\nsatisfied without such a site. For that matter, I'm not even much of a cell\r\nphone user--I've got a digital phone, but it only works about half the time,\r\nand I don't bother to get anything else.\r\n\r\n            (To answer another query of yours: On the privacy issue, I subscribe to the\r\nScott McNealy position. When asked about this one time, he said something to\r\nthe effect of: \"You've already lost your privacy. Get over it.\" Some years ago,\r\nI wrote a book that was devoted, in part, to the rise of the credit card\r\nindustry. In doing that research, I became painfully aware of how much personal\r\ninformation was already \"sloshing around,\" as you put it. In other words, long\r\nbefore the Internet, this battle had been lost. And in truth, I don't much care\r\nwhat is discovered about my \"habits\" through my Web use.)\r\n\r\n            I was particularly glad you brought up AOL, for the story in the\r\nTimes that caught my eye today was headlined \"America Online Offers Free\r\nInternet Use in Britain.\" This is big, and potentially very dangerous for AOL.\r\nThe reason it is the most successful Internet company is that it has a huge\r\nrevenue stream because it charges a monthly subscription fee. There is no way\r\nit wants give away free what it used to charge for, but it is being forced to\r\ndo so by a British company that is offering free Web access--and has taken away\r\na big chunk of AOL's market share in Britain. This, of course, is precisely\r\nwhat Microsoft did to Netscape--it gave away for free a product (the browser)\r\nthat produced most of Netscape's revenues. Marc Andreessen, the former Netscape\r\nwonderboy who now works at AOL, must be having nightmares!\r\n\r\n            There it is again, though--the Net's ability to blindside an established\r\ncompany, to squeeze away profits, and to give consumers a deal that seemingly\r\nmakes no economic sense but is great for them. The irony is that the\r\nestablished company in this case is not some so-called bricks-and-mortar\r\ndinosaur, but a Net company! My friend and colleague Andy Serwer predicts that\r\nwithin 12 to 24 months, nobody will charge for Internet access. Where in\r\nthe world will that put AOL then?\r\n\r\n            I will say this for AOL. Unlike the folks at Netscape, who never figured out\r\nwhat to do when Microsoft took away their bread and butter, those guys at AOL\r\nare awfully resilient. They proved it a few years ago, when it was widely\r\nbelieved that their service would be rendered irrelevant by the growth of the\r\nInternet. And the company's performance during the past few years has been\r\nlittle short of astounding. I have no doubt they will adapt to broadband, and\r\ndeflect the threat posed by AT&T. And they've done a great job keeping\r\nMicrosoft from eating their lunch, which is no easy task. But can they adapt to\r\nthe potential loss of most of their revenue stream? I dunno. Do you?\r\n\r\n            I leave you with one other question, which I've been wondering about for\r\nawhile. When I was covering the Microsoft trial, I got to see two AOL\r\nexecutives testify: David Colburn, who was on the stand twice, and CEO Steve\r\nCase, who was deposed one day when the trial was in recess. They were both\r\nsmart, clever guys who could not be rattled, and easily deflected even the most\r\nhostile questions from Microsoft's lawyers. (Colburn struck me as one mean\r\nSOB.) But the trait they had most in common is that were both real wiseacres,\r\nsarcastic and darkly funny. Is that kind of sarcasm part of the AOL culture?\r\nAnd if so, what does it say about the company?\r\n\r\n            Best,\r\nJoe\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n   \r\n"},"properties":[{"key":"SourceSystemId","values":["9DE07GE5T2U4.BZZYMJ1IA3ED@mimefactory.state.tld"]},{"key":"Sender","values":["{\"Name\":null,\"Address\":\"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev\",\"RoutingType\":\"SMTP\",\"MailboxType\":\"Mailbox\",\"Id\":null}"]},{"key":"IngestedFromMailbox","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"BirthId","values":["7beaab80-98eb-4e26-ad49-ccbf859e5f5e"]},{"key":"SizeInKb","values":["11.706"]},{"key":"Sensitivity","values":["Official"]},{"key":"IsTransitory","values":["False"]},{"key":"SensitivityAssigned","values":["ClientAssigned"]},{"key":"AttachmentCount","values":["0"]},{"key":"IsCapstone","values":["False"]},{"key":"IsRecord","values":["True"]},{"key":"Classification","values":[""]},{"key":"MetadataGenerated","values":["2017-11-08T19:40:42.6232776Z"]},{"key":"MetadataGeneratorVersion","values":["0.1.1107.1"]},{"key":"Source","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"SourceType","values":["EmailExchange"]},{"key":"DispositionType","values":["Official"]},{"key":"DispositionDate","values":["2024-11-06T23:59:23Z"]}],"security":{"securityDescriptors":["RECORD","OFFICIAL","DS-BUREAU","POST-BRASILIA","COUNTRY-BRAZIL","GEO-WHA","eRecords"],"signatures":[]},"users":[{"userRoles":["From"],"id":122,"originalSmtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","smtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"firstName":"svcErecMbxPusher","userValidFrom":"2017-04-18T10:34:19.84","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\svcErecMbxPusher","orgUnit":"Enterprise
