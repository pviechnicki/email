The Japanese\r\n        themselves (in the big cities at least) can be seen more often than not\r\n        with some kind of shopping bag???they make very large, sturdy\r\n        ones???just on the off chance that they might want to buy something.\r\n        You cannot get to know this country properly, even if you don?t want to\r\n        buy anything, without exploring the rich and varied range of\r\n        traditional arts and crafts, the famous cornucopia of electronic\r\n        gadgets and precision instruments, or the impressively awful selection\r\n        of kitsch souvenirs in the major tourist centers.\r\n        Japan is notoriously expensive, so don?t expect fabulous\r\n        bargains. The country has succeeded economically by fixing the best\r\n        price it can get for everything, but the domestic market pays high\r\n        prices because of a stiff sales tax and surprisingly convoluted and\r\n        inefficient distribution systems. Japanese tourists visiting other\r\n        countries are still shocked to find Japanese consumer goods available\r\n        for far less than they have to pay at home.\r\n        Start by looking at the range of goods in the department\r\n        stores and hundreds of specialty shops in the underground shopping\r\n        centers before going off to find better prices at discount shops.\r\n        Department stores generally offer superb selections of everything???but\r\n        at Japan?s highest prices.\r\n        You might be tempted to do your shopping at the end of your\r\n        trip so you won?t have to drag all that electronic equipment,\r\n        lacquerware, ceramics, or whatever around the country with you.\r\n        Instead, consider buying everything you want as you go along, using\r\n        Japan?s remarkably efficient and inexpensive takkyubin courier delivery\r\n        services (available at the ubiquitous convenience stores) to forward\r\n        your larger purchases to your hotel, where they will be waiting for you\r\n        on your return to Tokyo or elsewhere. Given Japan?s relatively low\r\n        crime rates, you can be sure you?ll be reunited with your precious\r\n        souvenirs.\r\n        Hi-Tech Products\r\n        In Tokyo, the place to go for every electronic and computer\r\n        item imaginable???and plenty that you didn?t even know existed???is\r\n        Akihabara, an entire district devoted to specialty stores selling\r\n        mountains of electronic equipment often at very low prices. The larger\r\n        stores usually have a tax-free department offering a narrower range of\r\n        products designed for use abroad. English-speaking sales staff are\r\n        often on hand, but don?t expect the same discount prices that are\r\n        offered on the other floors, despite the tax-free incentive.\r\n        One draw for visiting gadget freaks is being able to buy the\r\n        very latest equipment several months ahead of its sales launch abroad.\r\n        However, cameras and electronic goods are rarely available at better\r\n        prices than those in New York City, still the world?s reigning discount\r\n        center. Those hunting for computer software and hardware should not\r\n        expect to find anything other than Japanese-language products for\r\n        sale.\r\n        Osaka?s equivalent hi-tech shopping district is\r\n        Nipponbashi, a very poor relation to Akihabara with neither the range\r\n        nor the prices available in Tokyo.\r\n        Note that local electric current is 100 volts/50 (or 60)\r\n        cycles, which is slightly different from the US and completely\r\n        different from Europe. Therefore, if you don?t want to bother with\r\n        converters, stick to the top-floor tax-free department specializing in\r\n        export goods designed for use around the world. Also note that Japanese\r\n        VCRs and TVs are designed for NTSC, the same broadcast system used in\r\n        North America. If you plan to buy anything for use in Europe or\r\n        elsewhere (where PAL is the main broadcast standard), make sure you\r\n        purchase a multisystem unit; only these are compatible with the various\r\n        broadcast standards in use around the globe.\r\n        Cameras. As an exception to the general rule of not making\r\n        big purchases until near the end of your visit, it makes sense to buy\r\n        camera equipment as soon as possible so you can try it out during the\r\n        trip. If a fault occurs, you can arrange to have it repaired or\r\n        exchanged before you leave. Most stores are good about exchanging\r\n        faulty goods. Note, though, that warranties are often valid in Japan\r\n        only, so check with the manufacturer for details of upgrading to\r\n        worldwide coverage. Shinjuku has Tokyo?s largest discount camera\r\n        stores, although these rarely offer better prices than those available\r\n        from New York?s famous mail-order outlets.\r\n        Traditional Goods\r\n        Kimono. Japanese silk kimono are magnificent but\r\n        staggeringly expensive. Most Japanese people save up for years to buy\r\n        one and then often spend an equal amount of time in debt after making\r\n        the investment. If you?re not among the world?s wealthiest tourists,\r\n        the good news is that new and nearly new kimono are usually sold for a\r\n        tiny fraction of their new prices at the big flea markets held at\r\n        temples, shrines, and other large communal sites. Many Japanese are\r\n        highly superstitious about acquiring second-hand goods, especially\r\n        clothing. In Tokyo, try the weekend market at Harajuku, and check the\r\n        English-language press for details of shrine and temple markets.\r\n        Kyoto?s two biggest flea markets are held at Toji temple (the 21st of\r\n        each month) and at Kitano Temmangu shrine (25th), but there are many\r\n        others.\r\n        Another alternative is the more modest but still elegant\r\n        yukata (light cotton kimono), traditionally in indigo-blue and white\r\n        and much, much cheaper than anything made of silk. Also look out for\r\n        the silk obi sashes used to tie kimono. Some are magnificently\r\n        decorative in their own right; if you don?t want to wear one, consider\r\n        an obi as an original and unusual wall-hanging in a Western home.\r\n        Antiques. For antique furniture and miscellaneous items,\r\n        Kyoto?s famous geisha district of Gion has one of the finest selections\r\n        in Japan. Even if you?re just browsing, the shops on Nawate-dori,\r\n        Furomonzen-dori, and Shinmonzen-dori offer a superb selection of\r\n        antique furniture, ceramics, masks, lacquerware, and Buddhist\r\n        objects.\r\n        Artwork. Attractively colorful ukiyo-e woodblock prints and\r\n        scroll paintings can be found in antique stores, second-hand\r\n        bookstores, and even temple markets. Prices vary enormously, so\r\n        shopping around usually pays off handsomely.\r\n        Pottery and ceramics. These are very much a living\r\n        tradition that has maintained its high standards. Most regions have\r\n        their own distinct styles, varying from Kyoto?s ornate and highly\r\n        glazed kiyomizu-yaki to the beautiful natural earthenware of Bizen in\r\n        Okayama and of Shigaraki near Kyoto. The town of Mashiko, to the north\r\n        of Tokyo, is well worth a day?s train excursion if you are interested\r\n        in seeing how some of Japan?s most celebrated pottery is made; the\r\n        prices here are slightly better than back in Tokyo. You can also stay\r\n        for lessons.\r\n        Lacquerware. You are least likely to go wrong in terms of\r\n        uniformly high quality if you?re in the market for lacquerware. Trays,\r\n        plates, bowls, and jewelry boxes are superbly finished???and not so\r\n        heavy as to create problems of excess baggage.\r\n        Paper goods. Fans, dolls, and hand-made stationery are\r\n        usually reasonably priced but produced with the same meticulous care as\r\n        are objects made from more precious materials.\r\n        Books. Tokyo?s Kanda district is devoted almost entirely to\r\n        second-hand books. The biggest neighborhood of its kind in the world,\r\n        it sells books in most European languages as well as Japanese. You?ll\r\n        also find excellent old maps and prints here, but the merchants know\r\n        the going price for everything; real bargains are few and far\r\n        between.\r\n        Entertainment\r\n        For information on all current Tokyo theater programs and\r\n        show times, consult free weekly magazines such as Tokyo Weekender and\r\n        Tokyo Classified, which are available in your hotel and in the foreign\r\n        book sections of the Kinokuniya and Maruzen bookstores.\r\n        As one of the most vivid and important expressions of\r\n        Japan?s traditional cultural heritage, theater is an adventure in\r\n        itself. Traditional Japanese drama, because of its stylization,\r\n        extravagant gesture, and solemn or even bizarre intonation, might be\r\n        difficult for Westerners. However, perseverance will be well rewarded\r\n        once you get used to the conventions. The impact of the impassioned\r\n        performances, aided by stunning costumes and elaborate make-up and\r\n        masks, can be utterly seductive; many a skeptic has emerged an addict.\r\n        Most Japanese theater aims less at developing a coherent plot, in the\r\n        Western manner, than at creating a particular tone, atmosphere, and\r\n        emotional extremes.\r\n        Noh\r\n        This is the oldest theatrical form, strictly speaking, and\r\n        also the most austere and demanding. Derived originally from ritual\r\n        dances of the imperial court at Nara and Kyoto, in the 14th century noh\r\n        became a fully developed masked drama of chanting, dancing, and highly\r\n        stylized acting. A hero and just two or three supporting actors enact\r\n        stories about gods, historic battles, ghosts, unhappy love, and\r\n        grief-stricken insanity. The more somber themes alternate with kyogen\r\n        farces about the life of the common people, which often feature a\r\n        satirical element.\r\n        The commentary is chanted by a chorus of six to eight\r\n        narrators (reminiscent of the chorus in Greek tragedy) who sit at the\r\n        side of the stage, while musicians positioned at the back of the stage\r\n        provide stark accompaniment with flute and drums. Contrasting with the\r\n        resplendent costumes, the set has an austere simplicity: a backdrop\r\n        (usually a permanent wall) of a large pine tree and some bamboo, with\r\n        no curtain. The stage is framed by a classical Japanese tiled roof\r\n        making a ?house? inside the theater.\r\n        Male actors, in masks, play all the roles. Characters often\r\n        take several minutes to enter and exit the stage, moving painfully\r\n        slowly in one of Japan?s greatest examples of form over function. For\r\n        aficionados, a noh performance is an eclectic nirvana. For many others,\r\n        it is powerfully soporific. Look around the audience and you?ll see\r\n        plenty of locals nodding off unselfconsciously.\r\n        Performances last several hours, with as many as five plays\r\n        in a program. You can probably manage at least a couple, and theaters\r\n        often provide a good buffet between plays. See the best ones at Tokyo?s\r\n        National Noh Theater, Kanze Kaikan at Shibuya, or Kyoto?s National Noh\r\n        Theater. Other fine troupes perform in Osaka and Kanazawa.\r\n        Kabuki\r\n        Ever since the Tokugawa shoguns restricted performances to\r\n        the samurai classes, noh drama has had a rather elitist appeal. Kabuki,\r\n        on the other hand, has proved much more popular. Equally stylized in\r\n        its way, kabuki is filled with fantastic color, movement, action,\r\n        drama, and comedy. The performers are folk heroes, and the greatest of\r\n        them???descendants of centuries-old dynasties of actors???are declared\r\n        ?Living National Treasures. ? Audience participation is at fever pitch,\r\n        with people yelling as their personal heroes enter: ?We?ve waited for\r\n        you! ? or ?You?re the greatest in Japan! ?\r\n        Nothing is spared in the way of costumes and d?cor; there\r\n        is no such thing as ?over the top. ? Ever since the 18th century,\r\n        revolving stages and trapdoors have been employed for supernatural\r\n        characters to rise to the stage. Popular, but art of the highest order,\r\n        kabuki tells stories of horror, blood and thunder, and passionate love.\r\n        Connoisseurs wait for the set pieces: the colorful parade of the\r\n        courtesan, a poignant seppuku suicide, the exciting fight scenes,\r\n        and???summit of the art of kabuki???the end of a love affair that the\r\n        heroine must break off, perhaps to save her lover?s honor, but never\r\n        because she no longer loves him.\r\n        ? She? is in fact likely to be a 60-year-old man. In the\r\n        early days of kabuki, at the beginning of the 17th century, the\r\n        acclaimed Kyoto dancers started to present increasingly erotic and\r\n        lascivious performances. With the audience?s passionate loyalties to\r\n        various star performers often leading to fights, the prudish Tokugawa\r\n        shogunate decided to ban female performers, fearing a breakdown in\r\n        all-important social order. However, they then found that the young men\r\n        who took over the female roles were also attracting ardent devotees\r\n        among military officers and even priests???homosexuality at that time\r\n        was not yet frowned upon. So they were in turn replaced by older men.\r\n        After years of study, these onnagata make an astoundingly subtle and\r\n        delicate art of capturing the gestures and movements of both young\r\n        girls and old crones.\r\n        At Tokyo?s Kabuki-za Theater, you can rent headphones for\r\n        the performance, providing simultaneous English-language translation of\r\n        the important dialogue along with explanations of the action and\r\n        conventions. Shows last up to four hours, but you can buy cheaper\r\n        balcony tickets for just part of the program. Kyoto?s kabuki troupe\r\n        performs in December and Osaka?s in May.\r\n        Bunraku\r\n        Japan?s celebrated puppet theater can be seen at the\r\n        National Bunraku Theater in Osaka?s Nipponbashi district, although\r\n        performances are also put on several weeks each year at Tokyo?s\r\n        National Theater. Don?t be misled: bunraku is theater for adults rather\r\n        than children, using the same dramatic themes, stories, and conventions\r\n        as in noh and kabuki but achieving a unique impact with the almost\r\n        life-sized, colorfully costumed puppets. The puppeteers, dressed all in\r\n        black, are initially distractingly visible on stage, manipulating and\r\n        walking around with their puppets???yet completely ?disappear? from\r\n        your perception as the magic of the drama sweeps you away. A detailed\r\n        English explanation of the plot is always provided, and wireless\r\n        recorded commentary units are sometimes available.\r\n        Bunraku?s heyday was the beginning of the 18th century,\r\n        when playwright Monzaemon Chikamatsu wrote works specifically for the\r\n        puppets that are regarded as among the greatest achievements of\r\n        Japanese literature. Heroism in battle and the noble values of the\r\n        samurai tradition are the principal themes. It comes as quite a shock\r\n        to watch a warrior performing his final gesture of ritual suicide and\r\n        realize that it?s only a puppet. The emotional effect is undiminished,\r\n        and the gory effects are usually horribly creative.\r\n        Film\r\n        The Japanese cinema industry is in lingering recession,\r\n        with growing numbers of people preferring to watch videos at home.\r\n        Don?t be surprised to see the latest Hollywood blockbusters on release.\r\n        These attract bigger audiences than do current local offerings, which\r\n        seem tawdry and unoriginal after the towering creativity of giants like\r\n        Kurosawa and Oshima. Despite occasional surprise international\r\n        successes (such as Unagi and Shall We Dance? ), Japanese cinema will\r\n        probably continue to be dominated by recycled ultraviolent gangster\r\n        tales until it undergoes long-overdue industry reforms.\r\n        Nightlife\r\n        If you?d like to see how the Japanese handle Western-style\r\n        popular music and dancing, you?ll find good quality jazz clubs,\r\n        conventional discos (with, naturally, fantastic electronic equipment),\r\n        and even country-and-western saloons, all in Tokyo?s cosmopolitan\r\n        restaurant districts of Akasaka and Roppongi. Teenagers might like to\r\n        join the open-air disco hordes at Harajuku, near Yoyogi Park.\r\n        Festivals and Folklore\r\n        Despite increasing urbanization and social change, Japanese\r\n        society retains its small, closely knit communities strongly dependent\r\n        on Shinto gods to ensure good harvests for survival. Forget the\r\n        karaoke, the bullet trains, and all those mobile phones for a moment.\r\n        With such a highly developed sense of ritual and tradition, Japan?s\r\n        matsuri (festivals) are much more than just fun for the community: for\r\n        many they remain integral to life itself. There is at least one\r\n        festival happening somewhere in Japan on any day of the year.\r\n        Each region has its own festivals or variations on the\r\n        large national ones. Most honor either Shinto deities and shrines or\r\n        major Buddhist temples. Buddhist festivals are usually fairly\r\n        restrained affairs, often involving an important image of the Buddha\r\n        that might be available for public viewing only on this occasion.\r\n        The real drama is at Shinto festivals. Some are austere\r\n        purification ceremonies involving traditional music, chanting, dance,\r\n        and often fire. At the opposite extreme are massive, almost riotous\r\n        processions of thousands of bellowing, sweat-drenched men fighting to\r\n        carry a huge portable shrine through the streets to a symbolic\r\n        destination. Such is their exuberance and rapture that real outbreaks\r\n        of violence can occur. These events have to be seen to be believed:\r\n        they demonstrate the perfect flip-side of the supposedly reserved\r\n        Japanese character.\r\n        Festivals are where superficially modern Japan gives way to\r\n        the old, where ancient traditions are upheld, especially in remote\r\n        rural districts. But there is usually a strong commercial aspect to the\r\n        celebrations. Some rural communities devise small but colorful\r\n        festivals to galvanize community spirit and the local economy by\r\n        attracting badly needed domestic tourists.\r\n        Many festivals, though, are so spectacular that it is worth\r\n        planning your visit specifically so you can attend. Definitely check\r\n        with your nearest Japan National Tourist Office for information when\r\n        planning your trip. Note that since many festivals follow the lunar\r\n        calendar, the actual dates vary from year to year. With thousands of\r\n        festivals and ceremonies taking place annually, this entire book\r\n        wouldn?t provide enough space to describe them all. Instead, we offer a\r\n        sampling of large and small festivals. But when planning a visit, some\r\n        supplementary research will probably uncover unexpected nuggets.\r\n        January. In Japan, New Year?s Day is the big festival,\r\n        closest in spirit to Christmas in the West, the time when relatives and\r\n        friends pay visits to each other and to the local shrines. New Year?s\r\n        Eve is a quieter, more solemn affair than in the West, when the\r\n        Japanese flock to famous shrines to pray for good fortune for the\r\n        coming year. People decorate houses, shops, offices, and even cars with\r\n        a bouquet of pine and bamboo, symbols of evergreen stability and\r\n        upright behavior. In Tokyo on 2 January, the inner grounds of the\r\n        Imperial Palace are opened to the public, with thousands coming to pay\r\n        their respects to the emperor and enjoy a closer peek at his palace\r\n        than is possible during the rest of the year.\r\n        Closet pyromaniacs shouldn?t miss Nara?s Wakakusayama Turf\r\n        Burning ceremony on 15 January, when people dressed as warrior monks\r\n        burn the entire hillside of Mt. Wakakusa after sunset, creating one of\r\n        the year?s most photographed spectacles, visible from miles around. The\r\n        15th is also Coming-of-Age Day nationwide, a milestone event for\r\n        20-year-olds attaining the age of majority. They attend special\r\n        ceremonies at local community halls, and women dress in unusually\r\n        opulent fur-trimmed kimono worn only on this special day.\r\n        February. The important setsubun festival marks the end of\r\n        winter around the country on 3?4 February. With demons represented by\r\n        priests wearing fearsome masks, onlookers throw beans to drive them\r\n        away while shouting, ?Demons out, good fortune in! ? The 3rd and 4th\r\n        are also one of the two occasions each year when the 3,000 lanterns of\r\n        the Kasuga Grand Shrine in Nara are lit. (The event is repeated on\r\n        14?15 August. )\r\n        Up in Hokkaido, Sapporo holds its internationally popular\r\n        Snow Festival (during the first or second week of February). The\r\n        highlight is an ice sculpture competition at Odori Park, with huge\r\n        superbly detailed models of castles, towers, and giant characters both\r\n        traditional and modern. Throughout Japan, children living in snowy\r\n        areas look forward each year to the Kamakura Festival, when they build\r\n        igloo-type snow houses.\r\n        March. On 3 March is the Hina Doll Festival, a special\r\n        event for young girls. Exquisitely detailed dolls in ancient costumes\r\n        representing the imperial couple and other aristocrats are displayed\r\n        for good luck. Some shrines display thousands of dolls brought by the\r\n        faithful.\r\n        Another annual highlight is the two-week O-Mizu-tori\r\n        Festival at Nara?s Nigatsudo Temple, one of Todaiji?s subtemples.\r\n        Although the central event is a solemn and highly symbolic\r\n        water-drawing ceremony, the crowds turn out in force for the more\r\n        public and spectacular fire ceremonies. Every night from the 1st to the\r\n        14th, in a highly dramatic display clearly designed to entertain,\r\n        temple priests brandishing long poles with a flaming cedar ball at each\r\n        end run along the front of the verandah, deliberately showering the\r\n        large crowd below with burning embers. (believed to bring good luck for\r\n        the coming year, having burned away the transgressions from the\r\n        previous one). In long-exposure photographs of this display, the entire\r\n        temple appears to be on fire. There is nothing like this anywhere.\r\n        Photographers: Miss this at your peril!\r\n        Another visual treat in March is the annual fertility\r\n        festival held at Tagata Jinja in Gifu Prefecture, north of Nagoya. This\r\n        amazing shrine celebrates an object that transcends borders and\r\n        cultural barriers: the human penis. Phalluses huge and humble, wooden\r\n        and stone are enshrined and worshipped here. And on 15 March each year,\r\n        the mightiest specimen, a 2 m (6.5 ft) monster made of Japanese cypress\r\n        and weighing over 270 kg (600 pounds) is slowly carried through this\r\n        small town, bulging out of its portable shrine. See it and you still\r\n        won?t believe it.\r\n        On 18 March the Golden Dragon dance is held at Tokyo?s\r\n        Senso-ji Temple (in Asakusa), accompanied by a ceremonial carriage\r\n        bearing several geisha playing traditional musical instruments.\r\n        April. The Buddha?s birthday is celebrated with flower\r\n        festivals held throughout Japan. The best place to view the spring\r\n        azaleas is at the Azalea Festival in the last week of April at Tokyo?s\r\n        Nezu shrine. In the Kansai region, peony lovers head for Hasedera\r\n        Temple in rural Nara. April is also cherry blossom season, with\r\n        blossom-viewing picnics (hanami) held in parks and temples throughout\r\n        Japan as the cherry-blossom ?front? makes its steady progress\r\n        northward. On the 14th and 15th the city of Takayama in Gifu Prefecture\r\n        holds one of Japan?s greatest processions of large, colorful\r\n        floats.\r\n        May. From the end April and into early May is Golden Week,\r\n        the unofficial name for the conjunction of three major national\r\n        holidays (Green Day, Constitution Day, and Children?s Day). Since this\r\n        is the only time many Japanese are permitted to take a vacation, it is\r\n        the worst time to visit Japan, since every hotel, inn, train, and even\r\n        plane is booked up months in advance. Although Boys? Day was officially\r\n        renamed Children?s Day to include girls, the reality is taking some\r\n        time to catch on. This festival features giant carp streamers flying\r\n        from poles throughout Japan. The carp?s ability to struggle upstream\r\n        against a strong current is regarded as a fit model for Japanese\r\n        boys.\r\n        On 15 May, Kyoto celebrates its Hollyhock Festival (Aoi\r\n        Matsuri). This ancient ritual is meant to pave the way for a good\r\n        harvest, with branches of hollyhock to stave off thunder and\r\n        earthquakes. The hollyhock decorates a big red oxcart, accompanied from\r\n        the Imperial Gosho Palace by 300 Kyoto citizens dressed in splendid\r\n        Heian-period costumes.\r\n        June. From June onward, ukai celebrates the ancient use of\r\n        cormorant birds to catch aiyu, a popular river fish. The animal rights\r\n        movement has yet to penetrate Japan in any significant way: the\r\n        cormorants? throats are constricted so they can?t swallow the fish they\r\n        catch underwater, and their owners retrieve the catch when the hapless\r\n        birds resurface. The various events held around Japan are usually\r\n        highly ceremonial, with blazing torches illuminating the\r\n        proceedings.\r\n        July. Kyoto?s Gion Festival (17?24 July) is the most\r\n        elaborate procession of the year, with its grandiose floats and glowing\r\n        lanterns. Originally, the festival invoked the help of the gods against\r\n        a plague in medieval Kyoto; highly commercialized imitations of it are\r\n        now celebrated all over the country. Immediately after Gion, on the\r\n        24th and 25th, Osaka holds its flamboyant and mammoth Tenjin Matsuri,\r\n        starting from the Temmangu shrine. It has fireworks, flaming torches,\r\n        and gaily decorated floats on the central Okawa River.\r\n        August. At the height of the summer swelter in July and\r\n        August is O-bon, a colorful and joyous national Buddhist festival\r\n        honoring the spirits of deceased ancestors. People travel around the\r\n        country to clean their family tombs and gravestones. At Nagasaki in\r\n        mid-August, glowing lanterns decorate the graveyards, while other\r\n        lanterns are put out to sea on model boats to take the departed souls\r\n        back to their other world. Like Golden Week in April?May, this is a\r\n        great time to avoid Japan unless you relish competing for every train\r\n        seat and hotel bed with millions of others. So bad is the traffic that\r\n        many of the country?s expressways come to a virtual standstill.\r\n        On the 14th and 15th of the month is the year?s second\r\n        lighting-up of the thousands of lanterns at Kasuga Grand Shrine in\r\n        Nara.\r\n        Further information. For complete details of these and\r\n        other major festivals held annually around Japan, check the JNTO\r\n        website at <www.jnto.go.jp>.\r\n        Sports\r\n        When the Japanese decide to do something, they seem to take\r\n        a ?total-immersion? route, buying the latest outfits and equipment so\r\n        that they look like seasoned professionals before they take a single\r\n        lesson. This provides insight into the important Japanese concept of\r\n        katachi (form), the rough equivalent of ?It isn?t what you do; it?s the\r\n        way that you do it. ? It is quite common to see Japanese men of all\r\n        ages standing on train platforms or outside a building practicing their\r\n        stroke with an imaginary golf club.\r\n        Participant Sports\r\n        Tennis. With land prices notoriously high, urban courts are\r\n        crowded and expensive, so your best bet is at the seaside or hot-spring\r\n        resorts. If necessary, get your hotel to help you make\r\n        reservations.\r\n        Golf. Unsurprisingly, golfing is prohibitively expensive.\r\n        You will have to share the Japanese golfer?s manic obsession to want to\r\n        shell out green fees of well over US$100 at top clubs during peak\r\n        periods. The best way to enjoy a round of golf is as the guest of a\r\n        Japanese friend or business associate.\r\n        Swimming. Beaches close to Tokyo and Osaka are crowded\r\n        (except after 1 September, when summer for the Japanese has officially\r\n        ended). So you are better off going south to Kyushu, around Shimabara\r\n        and the more secluded of the Amakusa Islands (for snorkeling and\r\n        scuba-diving, too) or to the spa resort of Ibusuki. Water sports\r\n        enthusiasts go south to the beaches of Okinawa, the liveliest being\r\n        Moon Beach at Nakadomari.\r\n        Fishing. One of the joys of fishing in Japan is taking the\r\n        catch back to your Japanese-style inn and having the cook grill it for\r\n        you or turn it into sushi or sashimi (depending on your degree of faith\r\n        in the cleanliness of Japan?s highly polluted rivers). Freshwater\r\n        angling???for bass, carp, or trout???is good anywhere in the lakes and\r\n        streams, best of all up in Hokkaido, where you stand a decent chance of\r\n        hooking a salmon. Sea bream and sea bass are the most frequent catch in\r\n        coastal waters. Ask about license restrictions at the local tourist\r\n        office.\r\n        Skiing. Japan has a number of excellent skiing areas, which\r\n        quickly get very crowded in season. Winter sports are one of Hokkaido?s\r\n        main draws for domestic tourism, with popular ski resorts at Teine\r\n        Olympia (outside Sapporo), Niseko, and Kiroro. Others are Zao (in\r\n        Tohoku) and a number of resorts in Joshin-etsu Kogen National Park in\r\n        the Japan Alps, where there are now splendid facilities thanks to the\r\n        1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano.\r\n        Spectator Sports\r\n        Baseball. The game is at least as popular in Japan as it is\r\n        in the US. It was introduced in the 19th century, together with\r\n        railways, cameras, and whisky. Today baseball is big business, with\r\n        cheerleaders, balloons, and variations on Major League hype. The major\r\n        professional teams are owned by the biggest publishing empires or\r\n        department store chains, each combining their company name with the\r\n        time-honored American nicknames, the most famous being the Yomiuri\r\n        Giants. Japanese commentators have happily adopted the American jargon\r\n        of ?Strike one, ball two,? ?home run,? and ?pinch hit. ? In Tokyo you\r\n        can see games at Korakuen Stadium, and in Osaka at Nissei.\r\n        Sumo. Of the traditional Japanese sports, sumo wrestling is\r\n        the most popular. This ancient sport originated more than 15 centuries\r\n        ago in Shinto ceremonies. Today, sumo champions???the only men still\r\n        allowed to wear the samurai warrior?s gleaming top-knot hairdo???are\r\n        national heroes and are much in demand for TV commercials. At the\r\n        national level, there are a total of 575 wrestlers classed in six\r\n        divisions according to their win-loss ratio in the annual tournaments.\r\n        The highest division is the makuuchi, of which the champions are known\r\n        as yokozuna. These giants weigh anything from 90 to 165 kg (200 to 350\r\n        pounds), yet they have grace, dignity, and suppleness that belie their\r\n        massive bulk.\r\n        The dohyo-iri (ring entry) ceremony opening the tournament\r\n        is a fascinating spectacle. The champions strut into the arena in\r\n        richly embroidered silk ?aprons? covering the solid band protecting\r\n        their midriffs. In the dohyo, a raised mound of hard clay some 4.6 m\r\n        (15 ft) in diameter under a large suspended Shinto-roof-style\r\n        canopy,toss salt across the dohyo to purify it of evil spirits, swagger\r\n        around, and commence the all-important ?psyching-out? of the opponent.\r\n        Pointedly avoiding each other?s eyes, they raise a massive leg into the\r\n        air (to a height that would do a professional dancer proud), slam it\r\n        down with a mighty thud, and lower themselves into the characteristic\r\n        squat. This goes on for up to five minutes???all part of the great\r\n        ritual buildup of tension before the wrestlers clash. Note that\r\n        indulging in these highly stylized opening theatrics is a privilege of\r\n        top-ranked wrestlers only.\r\n        The aim is for one wrestler to force the other out of the\r\n        ring or to make him touch the floor with anything other than his feet.\r\n        The bout is usually over in one or two minutes, sometimes mere seconds,\r\n        but the intensity of the struggle and the sheer visual drama make for\r\n        compelling entertainment.\r\n        Sumo tournaments are held in January, May, and September at\r\n        the Kuramae Kokugikan in Tokyo, during March in Osaka, in July in\r\n        Nagoya, and in November in Fukuoka (Kyushu). The bouts commence in the\r\n        morning, but the real crowds start arriving only in late afternoon. A\r\n        little known secret is that a standing ticket (usually around US$12)\r\n        actually gives you the run of the arena: you can move around freely,\r\n        sit in unoccupied seats, and even enjoy the action from the ringside\r\n        until the actual ticket-holders arrive later on. If you can, go out of\r\n        your way to spend a few hours of watching live sumo. There is simply\r\n        nothing on earth like it.\r\n        Martial arts. Most major cities have martial arts halls,\r\n        where you can watch kendo (fencing with bamboo staves) as well as the\r\n        famed sports of judo and aikido. The latter is a highly spiritual art\r\n        in which, unlike judo, the opponents do not grapple at the beginning of\r\n        the bout. Instead, they maneuver and feint, applying the strength of\r\n        their will (ki) rather than physical strength to overcome the\r\n        other.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"},"properties":[{"key":"SourceSystemId","values":["PNAYBLZ5T2U4.YOFDTSPJJQXN1@mimefactory.state.tld"]},{"key":"Sender","values":["{\"Name\":null,\"Address\":\"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev\",\"RoutingType\":\"SMTP\",\"MailboxType\":\"Mailbox\",\"Id\":null}"]},{"key":"IngestedFromMailbox","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"BirthId","values":["0f7aa456-b679-4a00-9409-178b4a97dc50"]},{"key":"SizeInKb","values":["70.948"]},{"key":"Sensitivity","values":["Official"]},{"key":"IsTransitory","values":["False"]},{"key":"SensitivityAssigned","values":["ClientAssigned"]},{"key":"AttachmentCount","values":["0"]},{"key":"IsCapstone","values":["False"]},{"key":"IsRecord","values":["True"]},{"key":"Classification","values":[""]},{"key":"MetadataGenerated","values":["2017-11-09T00:03:57.1200717Z"]},{"key":"MetadataGeneratorVersion","values":["0.1.1108.2"]},{"key":"Source","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"SourceType","values":["EmailExchange"]},{"key":"DispositionType","values":["Official"]},{"key":"DispositionDate","values":["2024-11-06T23:57:00Z"]}],"security":{"securityDescriptors":["RECORD","OFFICIAL","POST-BRASILIA","COUNTRY-BRAZIL","GEO-WHA","eRecords"],"signatures":[]},"users":[{"userRoles":["From"],"id":122,"originalSmtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","smtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"firstName":"svcErecMbxPusher","userValidFrom":"2017-04-18T10:34:19.84","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\svcErecMbxPusher","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"svcErecMbxPusher","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7143","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":128,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb3Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb3Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"isDomestic":true,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb3Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","country":"Brazil","departmentNumber":"Embassy Brasilia","samAccountName":"eRecJmb3Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7150","postPk":4,"postName":"Brasilia","postLocation":"Brasilia","postType":"Embassy","geoCode":"WHA","geoDescription":"Western Hemisphere","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":150,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb2Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb2Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"isDomestic":true,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb2Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","departmentNumber":"Embassy London","samAccountName":"eRecJmb2Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7148","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":172,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb35Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb35Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb35Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"eRecJmb35Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7214","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":194,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb16Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb16Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb16Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"eRecJmb16Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7176","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"}]},"errata":[{"type":"Warning","task":"ParseJournal","field":"JournalReport","value":"","reason":"No Journal Reports for Email"},{"type":"Information","task":"ParseMime","field":"SensitivityAssigned","value":"","reason":"No Sensitivity Assigned Header"}],"indexLocation":"email_official7yr_2017_m11"}
