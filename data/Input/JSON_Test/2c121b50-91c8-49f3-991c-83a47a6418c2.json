The\r\n        NRs regulate transcription by binding to response elements\r\n        in the promoters of target genes and acting as scaffolds\r\n        for the assembly of large coactivator and corepressor\r\n        complexes [ 4 ] . NR coactivators include the p160s\r\n        (including GRIP1/TIF-2, SRC-1 and AIB1/ACTR/pCIP). The\r\n        p160s enhance transcription by binding histone\r\n        acetyl-transferases such as p300/CBP and pCAF [ 5 ] and\r\n        methyl-transferases such as CARM1 and PRMT [ 6 ] which, in\r\n        turn, enhance transcription by modification of chromatin.\r\n        Other NR coactivators include TRAP220 [ 7 ] , which is part\r\n        of a larger complex (TRAP/DRIP/SMCC/mediator) that contacts\r\n        the basal transcription machinery and PGC-1 [ 8 ] , a cold\r\n        inducible coactivator that binds CBP and SRC-1 and proteins\r\n        involved in RNA processing [ 9 ] . NR corepressors include\r\n        NR corepressor (N-CoR) and silencing mediator of retinoid\r\n        and thyroid responsive transcription (SMRT) [ 4 ] . Both\r\n        N-CoR and SMRT repress transcription, at least in part, by\r\n        binding to histone de-acetylases (HDACs) either directly or\r\n        indirectly through other corepressor complex components.\r\n        Other known NR corepressors include RIP140 [ 10 ] ,\r\n        Hairless [ 11 ] , short heterodimer partner (SHP) [ 12 ]\r\n        and DAX [ 13 ] , and receptor specific corepressors such as\r\n        the estrogen receptor (ER) interacting proteins REA and\r\n        HET-SAFB [ 14 15 ] .\r\n        Generally, NR transcriptional activity is dictated by\r\n        the balance between coactivator and corepressor\r\n        recruitment, and one of the most important factors that\r\n        influences this balance is the absence or presence of\r\n        agonist ligands (reviewed in [ 4 ] ). Unliganded NRs such\r\n        as thyroid (TRs) and retinoid receptors (RARs) bind\r\n        corepressors, and ligand promotes release of corepressor\r\n        and subsequent binding of coactivators. The mechanism of\r\n        this coregulator exchange is well understood. NRs consist\r\n        of three domains, the N-terminal domain (which contains a\r\n        context-specific activation function AF-1), the central DNA\r\n        binding domain (DBD) and the C-terminal ligand binding\r\n        domain (LBD), which contains a hormone-dependent activation\r\n        function, AF-2. The unliganded LBD recognizes hydrophobic\r\n        motifs, termed interaction domains (IDs), which are\r\n        reiterated three times in N-CoR and twice in SMRT and\r\n        conform to the consensus L/IXXIIXXXL [ 4 ] (see also [ 16 ]\r\n        ). By contrast, the liganded LBD binds shorter hydrophobic\r\n        motifs termed NR boxes that are reiterated several times\r\n        within each coactivator and conform to the consensus LXXLL.\r\n        The LBD utilizes a large hydrophobic cleft composed of\r\n        residues along H3 and H5 to bind IDs [ 17 ] , and a smaller\r\n        hydrophobic cleft that is composed of residues in the upper\r\n        part of H3 and H5 and H12 (and corresponds to AF-2) to bind\r\n        NR boxes [ 18 ] . Thus, agonists promote coregulator\r\n        exchange by promoting the packing of H12 over the lower\r\n        part of the ID binding region, an event that simultaneously\r\n        completes the coactivator binding surface. In other cases,\r\n        however, the balance of coactivator and corepressor\r\n        recruitment is regulated by direct competition for the AF-2\r\n        surface, rather than ligand-dependent coregulator exchange.\r\n        RIP140, Hairless and DAX possess NR boxes that interact\r\n        with AF-2 [ 11 13 19 ] and these corepressors act as\r\n        negative regulators of the activity of the liganded NR.\r\n        The NR family contains two related ERs (ER? and ER?)\r\n        that conform to the typical three domain NR structure and\r\n        share extensive sequence homology in the DBD and LBD region\r\n        [ 20 21 ] . Analysis of the function of the individual ERs\r\n        in mouse knockout models suggests that the major\r\n        proliferative effects of estrogen are mediated by ER? and\r\n        not by ER?, which seems to play an inhibitory role in\r\n        proliferation in some studies [ 22 23 ] . The\r\n        ligand-binding properties of the ERs are different, with\r\n        ER? often exhibiting stronger binding to plant-derived\r\n        phytoestrogens [ 24 ] . More importantly, the ERs exhibit\r\n        isoform-specific effects on gene expression. Both ERs\r\n        enhance transcription from genes with classical estrogen\r\n        response elements (EREs), but ER? requires less ligand to\r\n        obtain maximal activation than ER? [ 25 26 ] . Likewise,\r\n        both ERs suppress the activity of the TNF? promoter in\r\n        response to estrogens, but ER? is a more potent repressor\r\n        than ER? [ 27 ] . However, some of the most striking\r\n        isoform-specific differences in gene regulation are\r\n        observed at promoters, such as that of cyclin D1, which\r\n        contain AP-1 sites or related cyclic AMP response elements\r\n        (CREs). ER? enhances AP-1 activity in response to\r\n        estrogens, [ 28 29 ] but ER? inhibits AP-1 activity in\r\n        response to estrogens [ 29 30 31 ] . ER? also completely\r\n        suppresses ER? activity at the cyclin D1 promoter and even\r\n        suppresses the activity of an ER? mutant that is\r\n        selectively superactive at AP-1 sites and CREs [ 29 ] .\r\n        Finally, ER? shows a unique capacity to enhance AP-1\r\n        activity in response to selective estrogen receptor\r\n        modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene, tamoxifen and ICI\r\n        182,780/Faslodex (ICI) [ 30 31 32 ] . Together, these\r\n        observations suggest that there are fundamental differences\r\n        in the way that the ERs bind unspecified cofactors that\r\n        modulate gene expression, and that some of these cofactors\r\n        must play a role in differential ER activity at AP-1\r\n        sites.\r\n        Although the poorly conserved NTD region clearly plays\r\n        an important role in isoform-specificity [ 32 33 ] , it is\r\n        also likely that there are differences in the better\r\n        conserved LBD region that contribute to differential ER?\r\n        and ER? activities. Phage display techniques have revealed\r\n        that ER? and ER? show different preferences in LXXLL\r\n        binding (reviewed in [ 34 35 ] ). Moreover, some cofactors\r\n        that contain LXXLL motifs show differential binding to LBDs\r\n        of the ER isoforms (reviewed in [ 36 ] ). SHP binds ER?\r\n        preferentially [ 37 ] , and represses ER? activity more\r\n        strongly than that of ER?. The PGC-1 related protein PERC\r\n        also binds ER? preferentially, and potentiates ER? activity\r\n        more strongly than that of ER? [ 38 ] . We recently\r\n        observed that ER? binds the C-terminal NR interacting\r\n        regions of N-CoR and SMRT in the presence of SERMs but not\r\n        estrogens [ 39 ] . In this study, we report that ER?\r\n        interactions with N-CoR and SMRT are promoted by agonists\r\n        and inhibited by SERMs. Thus, the ERs show completely\r\n        opposite ligand preferences of interaction with\r\n        corepressors. We discuss the potential significance of\r\n        these different modes of ER interaction with N-CoR in terms\r\n        of known isoform-specific behaviors.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Results\r\n        \r\n          Agonist Dependent ER? Interactions with N-CoR and\r\n          SMRT\r\n          To investigate ER? interactions with corepressors, we\r\n          examined the interactions of full length ER? (amino acids\r\n          1-530) with bacterially expressed C-terminal NR\r\n          interacting domain of N-CoR (amino acids 1944-2453) \r\n          in vitro (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1Breveals,\r\n          surprisingly, that ER? bound N-CoR in the absence of\r\n          hormone and in the presence of agonist ligands (E2, DES)\r\n          and phytoestrogens (genistein, coumestrol). Moreover,\r\n          these interactions were suppressed by SERMs (ICI,\r\n          raloxifene and tamoxifen). ER? bound to the coactivator\r\n          GRIP1 more strongly than N-CoR, but did so with an\r\n          identical ligand preference. Similar agonist-dependent\r\n          interactions could be observed between ER? and the\r\n          alternate NR corepressor SMRT \r\n          in vitro (Fig. 1C). Control binding\r\n          experiments performed in parallel confirmed that ER?\r\n          bound to N-CoR in the presence of SERMs, and not\r\n          estradiol (Fig. 1D) and that TR? bound N-CoR in the\r\n          absence of hormone, and was released in the presence of\r\n          T3, whereas TR? only bound GRIP1 in the presence of T3\r\n          (Fig. 1E).\r\n          To examine interactions between ER? and N-CoR in\r\n          mammalian cells we performed two-hybrid assays using a\r\n          GAL4 DBD/N-CoR C-terminus fusion protein as bait and a\r\n          VP16-ER? LBD fusion as the prey. Fig. 2shows that the\r\n          ER?-LBD bound N-CoR in the presence of agonists and\r\n          phytoestrogens, but not SERMs. Control two-hybrid assays\r\n          confirmed that a VP16-TR? LBD fusion protein bound N-CoR\r\n          in the absence of hormone, but not in the presence of T3.\r\n          E2 dependent binding of ER? to N-CoR was dose dependent\r\n          (Fig. 2B) with an EC50 (0.3 nM) that resembled that of\r\n          ER? binding to the GRIP1 NR box region (amino acids\r\n          610-770). Thus, ER? binds the N-CoR C-terminal NR\r\n          interacting region in the presence of agonists, but not\r\n          SERMs, and does so \r\n          in vitro and in mammalian cells.\r\n          Moreover, results from the two-hybrid assay indicate that\r\n          the ER? LBD is sufficient to obtain estrogen-dependent\r\n          interactions with N-CoR.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          ER? Interactions with N-CoR are Dependent on AF-2\r\n          and require H12\r\n          Unliganded NRs usually bind ID motifs (consensus\r\n          L/IXXIIXXXL) in the N-CoR C-terminus. To ask whether ER?\r\n          might bind these motifs in the presence of estradiol, we\r\n          examined the ability of peptides containing known NR\r\n          interacting motifs to compete for the interaction (Fig.\r\n          3A). A peptide overlapping to the N-CoR ID1 motif (amino\r\n          acids 2265-2291) that competes for N-CoR binding to\r\n          unliganded TR and RAR [ 16 ] failed to compete for\r\n          agonist-dependent ER? interactions with N-CoR. By\r\n          contrast, a peptide corresponding to GRIP1 NR box 2 did\r\n          compete for this interaction [ 40 41 ] . This finding\r\n          suggests that agonist-bound ER? does not recognize ID\r\n          motifs, and that ER? interactions with N-CoR more closely\r\n          resemble those with GRIP1.\r\n          NR interactions with N-CoR are usually mediated by a\r\n          hydrophobic cleft that spans residues from H3 and H5 and\r\n          includes residues that lie under H12 in the liganded\r\n          configuration [ 4 17 ] . These interactions are either\r\n          independent of, or inhibited by, NR H12 [ 17 39 42 ] . By\r\n          contrast, NR interactions with coactivators are mediated\r\n          by residues from the upper part of H3-H5 and also require\r\n          H12 itself [ 18 ] . Fig. 3Bshows that a mutation in a\r\n          conserved residue on H12 that is required for coactivator\r\n          binding (E493K) abolished the interaction of ER? with\r\n          both N-CoR and GRIP1. Moreover, other mutations in the\r\n          upper part of the H3-H5 region that comprises the AF-2\r\n          surface (D303Y, I310R and K314A on H3; V328R and L331R on\r\n          H5) abolished ER? interaction with both cofactors.\r\n          Control mutations in other regions of the ER? surface\r\n          left its interactions with N-CoR and GRIP1 either\r\n          slightly reduced or intact (these are L301R at the base\r\n          of H3, V361R in the S-bends, M379R in H8; L426R, T434R in\r\n          the H10 and Y488S in the H11-H12 loop). Thus, ER?\r\n          interactions with N-CoR are dependent on the AF-2 surface\r\n          (including H12) and, in this regard, resemble those of\r\n          ER? and GRIP1.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          ER? Binds an NR Box-Like Motif in the N-CoR\r\n          C-terminus\r\n          To map the region of N-CoR that interacted with ER?,\r\n          we examined ER? binding to a series of rationally\r\n          designed smaller fragments of the N-CoR C-terminus (Fig.\r\n          4). ER? did not bind two of these smaller fragments of\r\n          N-CoR (1944-2033; 2230-2322) that contain known ID motifs\r\n          (IDs 3 and 1 [ 16 ] ). ER? bound weakly to two regions of\r\n          N-CoR (2033-2123; 2123-2230), one of which (2033-2123)\r\n          contains an ID motif (ID2), but did so in a\r\n          ligand-independent fashion. However, ER? did bind to a\r\n          fragment that spanned the extreme C-terminus (2322-2453)\r\n          and did so in a manner that was promoted by E2 and\r\n          suppressed by ICI, much like the interactions of ER? with\r\n          the entire N-CoR nuclear receptor interacting region.\r\n          The interaction of ER? with the small N-CoR C-terminal\r\n          fragment (amino acids 2322-2453) was stronger than that\r\n          observed with the intact C-terminus (amino acids\r\n          1944-2453). This apparently improved binding is likely to\r\n          be a consequence of our methodology (West \r\n          et al . Unpublished data). In\r\n          general, expression of large fragments of the N-CoR\r\n          C-terminus in E. Coli yields a mix of full length protein\r\n          along with truncated products. To create the expression\r\n          vectors for the smaller fragments, truncated N-CoR\r\n          polypeptides that were obtained in E. Coli extracts were\r\n          subjected to protein sequence analysis and cDNA fragments\r\n          that coded for the major truncated products were\r\n          prepared. Each of the resulting polypeptides was\r\n          expressed very efficiently in E. Coli. The end product\r\n          that was obtained after GST purification essentially\r\n          consisted of a single short polypeptide as judged by\r\n          Coomassie stain. Binding of ER? to N-CoR (2322-2453) is\r\n          probably very efficient for two reasons. First, equal\r\n          amounts of GST fusion protein were used as baits for the\r\n          translated ER? protein in this series of experiments (3?g\r\n          per assay). Thus, N-CoR (2322-2453) is present in molar\r\n          excess over N-CoR (1944-2453). Second, as developed\r\n          above, preparations of N-CoR (1944-2453) generally\r\n          contain truncated products, so sequences corresponding to\r\n          the extreme N-CoR C-terminus (which binds ER?) is\r\n          markedly under-represented. In any case, the fact that\r\n          ER? binds weakly or not at all to the three N-CoR ID\r\n          motifs that mediate interactions with TRs and RARs and,\r\n          instead, binds in an agonist-dependent fashion to a\r\n          region in the C-terminus of N-CoR that has not previously\r\n          been implicated in NR interactions indicates that ER?\r\n          recognizes a novel protein sequence motif within\r\n          N-CoR.\r\n          The N-CoR C-terminus contains the sequence PLTIRMLS\r\n          (?-box, amino acids 2399-2406; Fig. 5). This sequence\r\n          does not exactly conform to the LXXLL consensus, but\r\n          contains features (underlined) that resemble the ER? H12\r\n          region (L \r\n          L LE \r\n          ML ), and artificial ER?\r\n          interacting LXXLL peptides (293, \r\n          P NLIS \r\n          LLS ; D47, \r\n          PL LLS \r\n          LLS ), both of which bind to the\r\n          ER? AF-2 surface [ 43 44 45 46 47 ] . Moreover, the\r\n          presence of a proline residue amino-terminal to the\r\n          hydrophobic groups is typical of so-called class II LXXLL\r\n          motifs which are found in ER? interacting cofactors such\r\n          as TRAP220 and RIP140 [ 45 ] . Finally, the unusual\r\n          C-terminal hydrophobic pair (ML) has been observed in ER?\r\n          and ER? H12 [ 43 44 48 ] , and in RIP140 NR boxes [ 19 ]\r\n          .\r\n          We investigated the significance of the ?-box in ER?\r\n          interactions with N-CoR. As Fig. 6Ashows, a synthetic\r\n          ?-box peptide competed for binding to N-CoR, albeit\r\n          somewhat less efficiently than native GRIP1 NR box 2.\r\n          Similar results were obtained in competition experiments\r\n          that used GST-GRIP1 instead of GST-N-CoR (data not\r\n          shown). The isolated ?-box also acted as bait for a\r\n          VP16-ER? fusion protein in mammalian cells, and did so\r\n          with similar efficiency to other known ER? interacting\r\n          peptides (Fig. 6B). Finally, mutations within the ?-box\r\n          (especially M2405A, L2406A) disrupted ER? interactions\r\n          with N-CoR in mammalian two-hybrid assays, but did not\r\n          affect TR? interactions (Fig. 6C). Thus, the ?-box is\r\n          sufficient to bind ER? and is essential for\r\n          agonist-dependent ER? interactions with the N-CoR\r\n          C-terminus.\r\n          Next, we examined whether the ?-box would bind other\r\n          NRs. The Gal-?-box fusion failed to recruit the ER?, TR?\r\n          or RAR? LBDs in mammalian two-hybrid assays (Fig. 7A).\r\n          Moreover, while the ?-box and GRIP1 NR box 2 peptides\r\n          both competed for ER? interactions with GRIP1, only the\r\n          NR box 2 peptide competed for ER? interactions with GRIP1\r\n          (Fig. 7B). Thus, the N-CoR ?-box is, at least to some\r\n          degree, ER? specific. Mutation of N-CoR to obtain a ?-box\r\n          sequence that more closely resembled a conventional LXXLL\r\n          motif (T2402L) led to enhanced hormone-dependent\r\n          interactions with ER? and permitted novel\r\n          hormone-dependent interactions with ER? (Fig. 7C). Thus,\r\n          some of the observed ER? specificity is probably a\r\n          consequence of an unexpected ability to tolerate the\r\n          absence of a leucine residue at the N-terminus of the\r\n          LXXLL motif. Together, our results indicate that ER? has\r\n          the potential to utilize its AF-2 surface to bind NR\r\n          boxes within coactivators or an NR box-like sequence in\r\n          the C-terminus of N-CoR.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          A HDAC Repressor Enhances ER? Activity\r\n          Since ER? bound N-CoR and SMRT in the presence of\r\n          estrogens, we investigated the possible involvement of\r\n          corepressors in the actions of agonist-bound ER? \r\n          in vivo . To perform this\r\n          experiment, we examined the effect of the HDAC inhibitor\r\n          trichostatin A (TSA) on ER? activity in transiently\r\n          transfected HeLa cells. Fig. 8Aconfirms that ER? shows\r\n          stronger transcriptional activity than ER? at a simple\r\n          ERE responsive reporter gene. TSA enhanced the basal\r\n          activity of the ERE-TK reporter gene by about\r\n          fifteen-fold in the absence of ER (see inset). However,\r\n          TSA also equalized the relative transcriptional activity\r\n          of both ERs. Fig. 8Bshows that the isolated ER? LBD\r\n          exhibited more potent transcriptional activity than the\r\n          ER? LBD. However, both LBDs showed similar\r\n          transcriptional activity in the presence of TSA. Thus,\r\n          corepressor complex HDACs must play an unspecified role\r\n          in restricting the transcriptional activity of both ER?\r\n          and, in particular, the ER?-LBD. This is consistent with\r\n          the notion that corepressors restrict the activity of\r\n          agonist-bound ER?-LBD.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Conclusions\r\n        NRs generally interact with the corepressors N-CoR and\r\n        SMRT either in the absence of ligand, or in the presence of\r\n        receptor antagonists, and agonists promote corepressor\r\n        release [ 4 ] . In this study, we demonstrated that ER?\r\n        binds to N-CoR in the presence of ER agonists such as\r\n        estradiol and DES and the phytoestrogens genistein and\r\n        coumestrol, but not in the presence of SERMs. Moreover,\r\n        this interaction is dependent upon ER? AF-2, including H12,\r\n        and is competed by NR box peptides but not ID peptides. The\r\n        hormone-dependent component of the ER? /N-CoR interaction\r\n        maps to the extreme C-terminus of N-CoR, which has not been\r\n        previously implicated in NR interactions, and requires a\r\n        sequence that resembles an ER?-specific NR box (PLTIRMLS,\r\n        ?-box). In this regard, ER? differs from ER?, which\r\n        probably binds ID motifs in a SERM-dependent fashion [ 49\r\n        50 ] and shows reduced binding to N-CoR in the presence of\r\n        estradiol [ 39 ] . ER? also differs from many other NRs,\r\n        which either bind N-CoR in the absence of ligand and are\r\n        released in the presence of ligand or interact with N-CoR\r\n        in the presence of antagonists but not agonists [ 4 ] .\r\n        The fact that the mode of ER? interaction with N-CoR\r\n        resembles that of NRs with coactivators [ 4 ] , or with\r\n        corepressors that modulate the activity of liganded NR\r\n        complexes, such as RIP140 [ 10 ] , raises the possibility\r\n        that ER? may be able to recruit N-CoR and SMRT to\r\n        estrogen-regulated promoters in response to agonists and\r\n        that the balance of overall ER? activity in the presence of\r\n        estrogens may be regulated by competition between p160s and\r\n        corepressors for the same ER? AF-2 surface. We recognize\r\n        that our studies do not directly address this issue. Our\r\n        attempts to identify ER? mutants that differentiate between\r\n        GRIP1 and N-CoR binding to analyze the role of\r\n        agonist-dependent corepressor binding have not yet been\r\n        successful (probably because ER? utilizes the same surface\r\n        to bind both cofactors). Moreover, transfection of N-CoR or\r\n        various mutated N-CoR derivatives did not significantly\r\n        affect ER? activity at EREs or AP-1 sites (data not shown).\r\n        We do not understand why, but in our hands, transfected\r\n        N-CoR also fails to affect TR or ER? activity (data not\r\n        shown), despite the fact that it clearly interacts with\r\n        both NRs. Nevertheless, we suspect that estrogen-dependent\r\n        N-CoR binding may represent an important component of the\r\n        regulation of ER? activity. As described in the\r\n        Introduction, ER? and ER? must interact differentially with\r\n        factors that modulate ER activity in the presence of\r\n        estrogens. The finding that estrogens suppress N-CoR\r\n        binding to ER? [ 39 ] , but promote N-CoR binding to ER?\r\n        represents the first demonstration of a corepressor that\r\n        shows completely distinct modes of hormone-dependent\r\n        interaction with the ER isoforms. Thus, N-CoR and SMRT and\r\n        their associated HDACs are excellent candidates to explain\r\n        some of the differential behaviors of the ER isoforms.\r\n        Consistent with this notion, the apparent weak\r\n        transcriptional activity of the ER? LBD is a consequence of\r\n        corepressor HDAC activity at some level (Fig. 8). Full\r\n        verification of the importance of ER? interaction with\r\n        N-CoR will await demonstration that ER? recruits N-CoR and\r\n        SMRT to estrogen-regulated promoters \r\n        in vivo , and that this event is\r\n        related to modulation of estrogen response.\r\n        While the ER isoforms have contrasting effects on AP-1\r\n        activity in the presence of estrogens, ER? truncations that\r\n        lack the NTD and ER? both enhance AP-1 activity in the\r\n        presence of SERMs [ 30 31 ] . Mutational analysis of ER?\r\n        action at AP-1 sites suggests these effects may be related\r\n        to N-CoR binding [ 39 ] , and we have proposed that SERM\r\n        action at AP-1 sites may therefore involve contacts with\r\n        corepressors [ 31 51 ] . The fact that ER? and ER? show\r\n        completely different ligand preferences of interaction with\r\n        N-CoR suggests that the target for SERM activation at AP-1\r\n        sites may not be N-CoR in both cases. Thus, this finding\r\n        complicates our attempts to explain this unusual\r\n        phenomenon. Perhaps the ER isoforms enhance AP-1 activity\r\n        by superficially similar mechanisms that involve different\r\n        cofactors. Alternatively, ER? and ER? action at AP-1 sites\r\n        could, in fact, be mediated by SERM-dependent contacts with\r\n        a common cofactor that is, as yet, unidentified. This\r\n        common factor may yet prove to be N-CoR if ER? interactions\r\n        with the ?-box were somehow masked \r\n        in vivo .\r\n        What features of the ?-box contribute to ER?\r\n        specificity? Intriguingly, the ?-box contains N-terminal\r\n        proline and C-terminal serine residues that extend the\r\n        homology of this region to an artificial ER?-specific\r\n        peptide [ 45 ] . However, the ?-box also lacks the first\r\n        Leu of the consensus LXXLL. A mutation (PL \r\n        T IRML>PL \r\n        L IRML) that restores the LXXLL\r\n        consensus increases ER? binding to N-CoR and permits ER? to\r\n        bind to N-CoR in the presence of estrogens in mammalian\r\n        two-hybrid assays. Thus, the unusual sequence of the ?-box\r\n        contributes to ER? specificity and ER? can tolerate the\r\n        absence of a conserved N-terminal leucine in LXXLL motifs.\r\n        ER? might bind to yet more cofactors that contain variant\r\n        NR boxes that resemble the ?-box. Other aspects of ER?\r\n        interactions with corepressors warrant further study. It\r\n        will be interesting to understand whether the weaker ER?\r\n        interactions with other regions of N-CoR (which are\r\n        insensitive to ICI) play a role in ER? binding (Fig. 4).\r\n        Finally, SMRT also binds ER? in the presence of estrogens,\r\n        but we have not explored the structural features that\r\n        promote this interaction. Intriguingly, human SMRT contains\r\n        a sequence insertion at the position of the hydrophobic\r\n        pair in the N-CoR ?-box, which apparently leads to deletion\r\n        of both residues (N-CoR/RMLS>SMRT/RLqagvmaS) [ 52 ] .\r\n        Perhaps SMRT contains a different NR interacting motif or\r\n        the N-CoR NR box sequence may be more complex than we have\r\n        initially reported here.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Methods\r\n        \r\n          Materials\r\n          Estradiol, diethylstilbestrol (DES), tamoxifen,\r\n          genistein, coumestrol, thyroid hormone, retinoic acid and\r\n          trichostatin A (TSA) were purchased from Sigma (St.\r\n          Louis, MO).
