For H-P,\r\nFiorina's arrival will bring some much-needed new blood into a somewhat tired\r\nand overly bureaucratic organization, as well as a welcome emphasis on Internet\r\ncommerce. For Fiorina, who had had a stellar career at Lucent, the hiring means\r\nthat she'll get a shot at running a major corporation years before she could\r\nhave expected to get the top job at her old company. And for the rest of us, at\r\nleast the rest of us who worry about who's running American business, it's\r\nexcellent finally to have a woman CEO of a Dow corporation.\r\n\r\n            Unfortunately, though not surprisingly, Fiorina has taken pains to downplay\r\nthe last fact. It's understandable that she doesn't want it to look as if she\r\nwas hired because she was a woman (although the fact that she'd be worried\r\nabout anyone thinking that in a world in which only three of the Fortune 500\r\ncorporations are run by women is somewhat astonishing). So we'll stipulate that\r\nshe was not hired because she was a woman. She was hired because she's a\r\nmanagerial whiz who helped transform Lucent from a staid spin-off of AT&T\r\ninto a prototypical bleeding-edge company. But that doesn't mean that the fact\r\nthat she is a woman is therefore irrelevant.\r\n\r\n            The irony is that when Fiorina says things like \"there really is not a glass\r\nceiling anymore,\" she's simultaneously making too much and too little of her\r\nown accomplishment. She's making too much of it because of her implicit\r\nargument that her ascension has smashed the ceiling. But the reality is that\r\nmost doors into the executive suite are still not open to women, and those that\r\nare have been opened only through struggle. Something like 95 percent of all\r\ntop executive positions are still held by men. There are lots of reasons for\r\nthat, of course, and most of them have to do with broader social realities and\r\nnot with corporate prejudice. But the old-boys' network is not a myth, and it\r\nstill takes a conscious effort on the part of boards of directors and hiring\r\ncommittees to promote women. (It may be telling, in fact, that New Economy\r\ncompanies have done a much better job in this regard.) It's hardly a\r\ncoincidence that Hewlett-Packard, which has a number of women executives in\r\npositions of real authority, was the first Dow company ever to hire a female\r\nCEO. Under outgoing head Lew Platt, H-P has emphasized diversity. Which, again,\r\ndoesn't mean that Fiorina wasn't the right choice. It just means that there's\r\nan institutional environment that allowed that choice to be made.\r\n\r\n            On the other hand, Fiorina is making too little of her accomplishment\r\nbecause she's downplaying just how talented she had to be to rise as fast as\r\nshe has and to overcome all the lingering prejudices against women executives,\r\nespecially in the old-line technology industry. (Needless to say, any time a\r\nCEO downplays her own talent, it's nice, but still ...) It's like Jackie\r\nRobinson. The first black major-leaguer had to be exceptional, because a merely\r\ngood player wouldn't have been able to convince people of what they didn't want\r\nto be convinced of, namely, that black players could play. In some ways, in\r\nfact, you could say that major league baseball wasn't really integrated until\r\nthe Boston Red Sox--the last team to integrate--signed Pumpsie Green, a\r\nmediocre-hitting utility infielder. When companies start being run by the\r\nfemale equivalents of Pumpsie--as most companies currently are by the male\r\nequivalents--then we'll know that the glass ceiling is really gone.\r\n\r\n            Of course, in theory the market should already have taken care of this.\r\nDiscrimination is economically irrational, which means that companies which\r\ndiscriminate against women should feel the pain in reduced competitiveness. But\r\nwe know that companies do discriminate even when it costs them. As my friend\r\nRachel Devlin, a historian at Tulane University, points out, after World War II\r\nmost industrial companies fired the women workers in their plants, even though\r\nthey would work for less than men, in order to restore the status quo that had\r\nprevailed before the war.\r\n\r\n            In any case, when it comes to the CEO market in particular, it's difficult\r\nto decide what constitutes \"rationality\" because the selection process is so\r\npersonalized and because the criteria for what constitutes a great CEO are so\r\nill-defined. As the sky-high pay for today's CEOs compared with their\r\ncounterparts of twenty years ago demonstrates, the insular nature of boards of\r\ndirectors means that purely economic considerations do not always prevail. And\r\nin that sense, worrying too much about why Fiorina was hired is fruitless.\r\nWhat's important is that she was hired and that if she's successful she'll make\r\nit easier for those after her. Even, or rather especially, those who are more\r\nPumpsie Green than Jackie Robinson.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
