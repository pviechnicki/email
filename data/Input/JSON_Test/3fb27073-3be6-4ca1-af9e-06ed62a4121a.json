It will,\r\nrather, treat those words and phrases, created in SF,\r\nwhich are now in common non-SF use.\r\n\r\n            There has been no entirely satisactory definition\r\nof science fiction: all proposals seem to exclude some\r\nwork which individual readers would include in the\r\ngenre.  It has been suggested that SF include only those\r\nstories which would be invalidated without their scientific\r\ncontent;  that fiction which concerns science,\r\nscientists, and the impact of science on humans;  that\r\nwhich explores alternate existences (whether future,\r\nextraterrestrial, or only in characters' minds) based on\r\nfacts and logical progression via scientific method.   As\r\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart wrote of\r\nhard-core pornography, so do I of science fiction: ?I\r\nshall not attempt further to define the kind of material\r\n...embraced within that short-hand description.\r\n...But I know it when I see it.?  The sources cited\r\nhere as SF have been classed as such by at least one\r\nreputable critic.\r\n\r\n            One alternate existence, the ideal state, was considered\r\nby the ancients (e.g., Plato's Republic and Aristophanes'\r\nThe Birds ).  However, it is Sir Thomas More's\r\nspeculative work of political science and sociology-- Utopia\r\n(from the Greek ou - `not' + topos -`place')--which\r\nbecame, generically, the impossibly\r\nperfect place.  The looking-glass image of utopia--dystopia--has\r\nprovided more numerous additions\r\nto the English lexicon.  Aldous Huxley excerpted\r\nwords from Shakespeare's The Tempest (?How beauteous\r\nmankind is!  O brave new world,/ That has such\r\npeople in 't.?) for the ironic title of his dystopic novel.\r\nThe phrase brave new world is now synonymous with\r\na nightmarish, technically advanced society.  George\r\n\r\n            This essay was selected as the First Prize winner\r\n($1,000) in the Sixth VERBATIM Essay Competition.\r\n\r\n            Orwell constructed an alternative future in his vision\r\nof the totalitarian state, Nineteen Eighty-Four .  The\r\nwork has given English a small lode of unpleasantries:\r\nthe title itself connotes a society marked by government\r\nterror and propaganda destroying the public's\r\nconsciousness of reality (the OED Supplement also accepts\r\n1984 and 1984-ish as adjective forms); that government's\r\nofficial language, Newspeak , now indicates\r\nthe propagandistic or ambiguous language of, among\r\nothers, politicians, bureaucrats, and broadcasters\r\n(?revenue enhancement? for ?tax increase,? etc.); the\r\ntwisting of minds to the capacity to accept the validity\r\nof utterly contradictory opinions or beliefs, or double-think ;\r\nthe book's head of state, Big Brother , implies an\r\napparently benevolent, but really ruthless, omnipotent,\r\nand omniscient state authority.\r\n\r\n            Taking an uncomfortably short speculative step\r\nwas Stanley Kubrick's 1963 film, ?Dr. Strangelove, Or\r\nHow I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.?\r\nThe title character of this dark comedy seriously considered\r\nplans for and the ?beneficial? results of nuclear\r\nholocaust; such contemplation is strangelovian .\r\n\r\n            Robert A. Heinlein envisaged a more optimistic\r\nfuture in his 1961 novel, Stranger in a Strange Land .\r\nIts Martian-reared main character advocates advancing\r\nthe empathic capability of the human mind so\r\nhumans can grok `embrace others with profound, intuitive\r\nunderstanding.'  It is not clear why Heinlein chose\r\nsuch an unpretty word for such a beautiful concept\r\n(maybe it is euphonious to the Martian auditory apparatus);\r\nit has, nevertheless, caught on.\r\n\r\n            Monsters have had starring roles in SF from its\r\nearly years.  The archetypal uncontrollable creation-gone-amok\r\nis Frankenstein's monster , commonly familiarized\r\nto Frankenstein by the incognizant who\r\nthus disserve Mary Shelley's Baron Frankenstein, the\r\nmonster's creator.  The Baron may have been misguided,\r\nbut at least he was not so mad a scientist as to\r\nexperiment on himself.  That lack of insight was shown\r\nby Robert Louis Stevenson's good Dr. Jekyll ( The\r\nStrange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , 1886), whose\r\nimpressive bodily transformations to his evil alter ego\r\nmade Jekyll-and-Hyde descriptive of persons who alternately\r\ndemonstrate good and evil behavior.\r\n\r\n            The recurrent motif of time travel came to the\r\nfore in H.G. Wells's The Time Machine (1895), considered\r\nby some the first work of true SF.  The Wells prototype,\r\na controllable time-space traveler, is used allusively\r\nby historians and forecasters (C. Day Lewis, in\r\n?How Poetry Began? (1944), wrote ?To find this out,\r\nwe'll have to jump into a Time Machine, put its gear\r\nlever into reverse, and race backwards through many\r\nthousands of years into prehistoric time.?).  Einsteinian\r\nrelativity theory, with its absolute maximum speed\r\nlimit (the speed of light), might have put an end to\r\nsuch speculation had it not also included the concept\r\nof curvature of space.  It was then but a small step to\r\nthe space warp, permitting faster-than-light (FTL to\r\nSF pros) travel by straight-line shortcutting across the\r\ncurves of space.  Except for its origin, in the British\r\nInterplanetary Society Journal, space warp has been\r\nrestricted to fictional use.  (After all, you can't have a\r\ngood intergalactic war when the next galaxy is, at the\r\nspeed of light, 2,200,000 years away.)  Not so its cousin,\r\ntime warp (fathered by Walter M. Miller in 1954:\r\n?They showed me a dozen pictures of moppets with\r\nLTR-guns, moppets in time-warp suits, moppets wearing\r\nCaptain Chronos costumes....?); originally another\r\nFTL, or time-travel device, it has entered standard\r\nEnglish, designating any sensation of time travel,\r\ntime discontinuity, or suspension of time's progress.\r\nTime-travelers need not be scientists or super-heroes.\r\nIn the 1934 book Music Ho!,  Constant Lambert noted\r\n?The most successful time traveler of our days was\r\nundoubtedly Serge Diaghileff.?\r\n\r\n            The catchwords of the classic science fiction era\r\nwere space and robot.  Citations in the OED Supplement\r\nfor space technology terms yield a Who's Who of\r\nSF: spacefaring (Poul Anderson, 1959); spacer `spaceman'\r\n(C.M. Kornbluth and Isaac Asimov, both in\r\n1958); spaceship (by John Jacob Astor, son of the fur\r\ntrader, 1894, C.S. Lewis in 1928, Arthur Clarke in\r\n1951); space-flight (Arthur Clarke, 1949); space sickness\r\n(Clarke, 1951).  The moment of launch into space,\r\nblast off, was created by Ray Bradbury (1951) in Silver\r\nLocusts: ?You could smell the hard, scorched smell\r\nwhere the last rocket blasted off when it went back to\r\nEarth.?  Slang's space cadet `an eccentric, especially one\r\nwho is stuporous or out of touch with reality' evolved\r\nfrom ?Tom Corbett, Space Cadet,? a 1950 television\r\nseries depicting the adventures of a 24th-century cadet\r\nin the Solar Guides, the interplanetary police force\r\nkeeping order in the Solar Alliance.\r\n\r\n            The properly dressed spaceman (Thrilling Wonder\r\nStories, 1942) must have a space suit (from the pulp\r\nScience Wonder Stories, 1929) for his rendezvous with\r\nthe aliens, of whom many are BEMs (bug-eyed monsters)\r\nor LGM (little green men).  (Scientists currently\r\nsearching the radio frequency spectrum for signals indicative\r\nof extraterrestrial intelligence refer to their\r\ngoal--positive intelligent signals--as LGM.)  Alas,\r\nsuch close encounters have not generally been friendly.\r\n\r\n            The battles between men and aliens have featured\r\nmanifold armament.  Authors extrapolated from\r\nRoentgen's 1895 discovery of x-rays and wrote of the\r\nheat-ray (H. G. Wells in War of the Worlds, 1898), and\r\ndisintegrator rays (George Griffith's The Lord of Labour,\r\n1911), not to mention ray-guns and blasters.  The\r\nweight of this fictional weaponry has popularized the\r\ndeath ray from its pulp SF origins to serious contemporary\r\nconsideration as laser technology has advanced.\r\nWeapons engineers have tried to euphemize and deromanticize\r\nthe terminology: death rays are called\r\n?beam weaponry,? and the U.S. antimissile defense system\r\nis SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative), despite the\r\npublic acceptance of the catchier Star Wars (from the\r\n1977 SF film).  We also should recognize SF as the\r\nsource of zap, which is used as noun, verb, and interjection\r\nto indicate `sudden power' (n.), to `kill in a\r\nburst' (v.), or the `sound effect for sudden destruction'\r\n(int.).  The OED Supp. traces the word from an\r\nepisode of the comic strip ?Buck Rogers in the 25th\r\nCentury? written by Philip Francis Nowlan in\r\n1929--?Ahead of me was one of those golden dragon\r\nMongols, with a deadly disintegrator ray...Br-r-rr-r-z-zzz-zap.?\r\n--to its most notorious use (cited in American\r\nSpeech in 1962), ?The jokester, pretending to be a\r\ncreature from outer space, pointed his cosmic ray gun\r\n(finger) at his friend's genitals and exclaimed, `Zap!\r\nYou're sterile.' ?\r\n\r\n            The Czech playwright Karel ?apek was the creator\r\nof robot a `machine which replaces a man' in\r\nR.U.R. (for ?Rossum's Universal Robots,? 1920); the\r\nword is from the Czech robota `forced labor.'  Though\r\n?apek conceived robots, it is Isaac Asimov who nurtured\r\nthem into fully developed SF characters.  While\r\ndoing so, Asimov furnished English with robotic and\r\nrobotical, roboticist an `expert in their production and\r\noperation,' robotics the `science of their design and\r\nfunction,' and roboticized `rendered mechanical.'  His\r\nlaws of robotics, which govern the relations of robots\r\nwith humans, were deemed by the OED Supp. editors\r\nto be of such significance that they are cited in their\r\nentirety.\r\n\r\n            As technology advances, life imitates art.  Appropriate\r\nwords are adopted from fiction.  Those remote\r\ncontrol arms with which laboratory personnel handle\r\ntoxic, radioactive, or infections substances are called\r\nwaldos (from Robert Heinlein's Waldo , 1942): the title\r\ncharcter, Waldo F. Jones, who has a crippling disease,\r\ninvents these devices to amplify the strength of his\r\nwasted mucles.  Not yet a reality, but often seriously\r\ndiscussed, is terraforming `aitering an extracterrestrial\r\nbody to make it capable of supporting  Earth's life\r\nforms.'  )The word and concept are Jack Williamson's,\r\nfrom a 1942 story, ?Seetee Ship.?)  In less commom use,\r\nbut a wonderful word all the same , is corpsicle , Larry\r\nNiven's term for a person frozen at death for future\r\nreuscitation and repair (?The Defenseless Dead,?\r\n1973).  When we read of the ongoing search for grav-\r\nity-carrying subatomic particles-- gravitons --and\r\nanti-gravitons, we should recall that Arthur Clarke\r\nwrote of antigravity as a propulsive force in 1946\r\n(Across the Sea of Stars?).\r\n\r\n            I could go on, but my ansible (FTL message receiver)\r\nis displaying a rpiority-one hyperspace is urgently required\r\nto mediate some tiff between local mutant\r\nreptillians and the invading rebel positronic androids.\r\nThe matter transmitter has warmed up.

The Word-Cross,\r\nas it was called, started its existence as just\r\nanother little Sunday supplement feature, with no\r\npretensions to permanence.  Yet it was to become the\r\nprogenitor of the now ubiquitous crossword puzzle.\r\nThe make-up of the grid has undergone various modifications\r\nin the course of time but the rules of the game\r\nhave remained unchanged.  As for the clues, they were\r\ncalled ?definitions,? and that indeed is what they\r\nwere.-- Or were they?  On closer inspection, classic\r\nclues appear to be divisible into three groups.  First,\r\nthere are synonyms, like rooster for COCK.  Admittedly,\r\nthere is no such thing as perfect synonymy, but the\r\nmeanings of many pairs of words are close enough for\r\nthis term to be used in the context of a pastime like\r\ncrosswords.  Second, a clue may name a class of objects\r\nwhich includes the answer, like bird for COCK.  A more\r\nspecific class, e.g., male bird , makes solution easier,\r\nwhereas a more general class, e.g., animal , would\r\ncomplicate the puzzler's task.  The third group comprises\r\ndefinitions proper.  Such a clue for COCK might\r\nread: adult male of the domestic fowl .\r\n\r\n            Crossword puzzles soon become very popular in\r\nAmerica, and perhaps even more so in Britain.  But\r\nsomeone must have felt that all this was too simple for\r\nour overtrained brains.  Straightforward definitions (of\r\nall three varieties were gradually replaced by play on\r\nwords, ambiguous phrasings, jumble games, and other\r\nverbal pranks.  A clue for COCK might thus come to\r\nread: number one in the pecking order dominates hens\r\nand crows (a quizzical statement, unless the word\r\ncrows is read as a verb) or even: creature with a cow's\r\nhead and a bullock's rump found in a coop (first letter\r\nof cow plus last three letters of bullock ).\r\n\r\n            The uninitiated may find these examples too bizarre\r\nfor words.  Still, the idea has caught on so well\r\nthat most British newspapers now offer two crossword\r\npuzzles each day.  One is in the classic style, commonly\r\nlabeled ?concise? or ?quick.?  The other is of the newer,\r\nplayful genre, often referred to as ?cryptic?; but this\r\ndesignation is by no means universal.  (A well-known\r\nAmerican language journal prefers the term ?Anglo-American.?)\r\nIn some countries, puzzles of this type are\r\ncalled ?cryptograms,? a name we shall use from here\r\non.  This article is an attempt to catalogue the main\r\ntools currently applied by cryptic puzzle-makers and\r\nsolvers.\r\n\r\n            A cryptogram clue can be a simple pun, like\r\n\r\n            \r\n               A .  A message that goes from pole to pole (8 letters) =\r\n\r\n            TELEGRAM\r\n\r\n            In most cases, however, it consists, as the previous\r\nexamples suggest, of two elements, each hinting at the\r\nanswer in its own way.  This construction makes sense\r\nsince each hint by itself is generally so vague or open-ended\r\nthat it evokes more potential answers than a\r\npuzzler's brain can handle.  Two such hints, however,\r\nhave only a few possible answers in common, so that\r\nthe solver can concentrate on them and pick the most\r\nprobable one.  This quest for the correct answer rests\r\non intricate mental processes which require no elaboration.\r\nOur purpose here is rather to devise a classification\r\nof the various types of clue elements (CEs) currently\r\nin use.\r\n\r\n            Let us start with the three groups of clues encountered\r\nin the classical crossword puzzle: synonyms,\r\nsuperordinates, and definitions.  Here are some examples\r\nof their cryptic counterparts:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               B .  A writer or two (5) = TWAIN\r\n\r\n            The first CE ( A writer ) indicates a class to which\r\nTWAIN belongs; the second ( two ) offers a synonym of\r\nanother possible meaning of the answer.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               C .  One who counts and recounts (6) = TELLER\r\n\r\n            The two CEs are telescoped.  Each of them defines a\r\nseparate meaning of the answer.\r\n\r\n            These are really old-time clues in new apparel; once\r\nwise to the system and having enough vocabulary entries\r\nin one's head (or a thesaurus handy on the shelf),\r\nit is not too difficult to decode them and arrive at the\r\nanswer.  The going gets tougher, however, as the two\r\nmeanings of the answer move further apart:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               D.  \r\n               This landlord is quite a character (6) = LETTER\r\n\r\n            The mechanism is clear: landlord = LETTER, (`one\r\nwho lets'), and character = LETTER, but the two LETTERs\r\ndiffer in both meaning and origin.  (Note that\r\nsome double-dealing has also gone on with the word\r\ncharacter !)  A third layer of camouflage is added in:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               E.  \r\n               Straight commotion (3) = ROW\r\n\r\n            The two ROWs differ in pronunciation as well as in\r\nmeaning and origin.\r\n\r\n            Just as disorienting are clues where the two meanings\r\nof the answer belong to different word classes:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               F.  \r\n               A more successful gambler (6) = BETTER\r\n\r\n            To mystify solvers even more, puzzlers may use words\r\nin an uncommon but perfectly legitimate sense, especially\r\nby attributing to certain words ending in -er the\r\nquality of agent noun.  Bloomer (for `flower'), butter\r\n(for `ram'), or even flower (for `river') are recurrent\r\nexamples, but solvers must always be on the alert for\r\nnew traps of this type:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               G.  \r\n               More than one anesthetic (6) = NUMBER\r\n\r\n            All of the above techniques rest, in one way or\r\nanother, on the meanings of words.  They make up the\r\nclass of Semantic Clue Elements.  Another class,\r\nequally important in cryptoland, is that of Graphic\r\nClue Elements.  Here, the object of play is the written\r\nform of the answer, or, more precisely, the letters of\r\nwhich that form consists.  The best known member of\r\nthis class is undoubtedly the anagram:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               H.  \r\n               Victim of injustice could be grounded (8) =\r\nUNDERDOG\r\n\r\n            The words could be which precede the anagram\r\ngrounded have a special function.  They inform solvers\r\n(if they get the message!)  that an anagram is lurking\r\nnearby.  Indeed, convention requires that anagrams\r\n(and all other Graphic CEs) be accompanied by such\r\nflags.  On the other hand, the cryptogram composer is\r\nfree to conceal these signals in all sorts of phrasal\r\nhocus-pocus:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               I.  \r\n               Overturned vote overturns all votes (4) = VETO\r\n\r\n            Some other anagram flags are broken, strange, unorthodox,\r\nmaybe, kind of , and a source of .  There are\r\ndozens of them, and new ones are being concocted\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n            Many anagrams spread over two or more words:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               J.  \r\n               Brave Tim changed quarterly (8) = VERBATIM\r\n\r\n            These are particularly tricky when short words, like\r\narticles or pronouns, are involved:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               K.  \r\n               An event is organized for Italians (9) = VENETIANS\r\n\r\n            \r\n               L.  \r\n               You can't take it with you--neither can I, unfortunately\r\n(11) = INHERITANCE\r\n\r\n            A subvariant of the anagram is the inversion:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               M.  \r\n               On reflection, the parts will hold together (5) =\r\nSTRAP\r\n\r\n            \r\n               On reflection is a flag to indicate that parts is to be\r\nread backwards.  Other inversion flags are coming\r\nback, returning , and going West .  Purists admit these\r\nonly for answers that run horizontally in the grid.  For\r\nthe ?down? words, they prefer turning up, traveling\r\nNorth , etc.\r\n\r\n            It is worth noting that the first element of clue M.\r\nconsists of the four words On reflection the parts .  The\r\ncomma, correctly inserted between reflection and the ,\r\nmay mislead, but such punctuational conflicts are considered\r\nperfectly legitimate, or even a piquant little\r\nfeature.  We shall return to this point later.\r\n\r\n            Another type of Graphic CE is the acronym:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               N.  \r\n               The leaders of the unassuming Royal Knights Society\r\ncan be a source of delight (5) = TURKS\r\n\r\n            \r\n               The leaders of is a flag intended to draw the solvers'\r\nattention to the initial letters of the words following it,\r\nwhere the answer lies for the taking.  The most common\r\nflag for acronyms is, as one would expect, initially .\r\n\r\n            The acronym does not stand by itself in the crypto\r\nrepertoire.  In fact, it is the key member of a whole\r\nfamily of Graphic CEs, all with their own specific\r\nflags to indicate whether the answer is to be composed\r\nfrom last letters, middle letters, or other word fragments.\r\nAn idea of the way they work has been given in\r\none of the introductory examples (the cow-bullock\r\ncreature).\r\n\r\n            A relatively new graphic technique is the sandwich.\r\nThe letters of the answer are left in their original order\r\nbut spread over two or more words:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               O.  \r\n               Lakeside city located inside the embankment or on\r\ntop of it (7) = TORONTO\r\n\r\n            or contained in a single word:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               P.  \r\n               A small capital in Czechoslovakia (4) = OSLO\r\n\r\n            Besides inside and in , common sandwich flags are part\r\nof and some of .\r\n\r\n            As the above clues demonstrate, a Graphic CE should\r\nbe accompanied not only by a flag but also by a Semantic\r\nCE.  This conventional rule also holds for the\r\nmembers of a third class, the Phonic Clue Elements.\r\nThese are based, just like the traditional pun, on\r\nhomophony:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Q.  \r\n               Critique, one hears, of a theatrical entertainment\r\n(5) = REVUE\r\n\r\n            Somewhat more involved is:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               R.  \r\n               It sounds in one sense (or in none) like simplicity\r\n(9) = INNOCENCE\r\n\r\n            Phonic CEs are not very often used, probably because\r\nall suitable flags ( I hear, it sounds, say , etc.) are so\r\nobvious that they threaten to give the game away.\r\nIn the above tour d'horizon, not all aspects of clue\r\nsetting have passed in review.  Nothing has been said\r\nabout the artful ways in which abbreviations, chemical\r\nsymbols, Arabic and Roman numerals, musical\r\nnotes, etc., may be used in clues.  Hardly any attention\r\nhas been paid to one-element clues.  (There are even\r\none-word clues, some of them particularly witty.)  No\r\nexamples have been given of answers that consist of\r\nmore than one word.  More important, no mention has\r\nbeen made of the possibility of chopping the answer\r\ninto convenient pieces which are separately represented\r\nin the clue by anagrams, synonyms, etc.\r\n\r\n            Just one real-life example:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               S.  \r\n               European city, home of the first person without\r\nperverse words (9) = ?\r\n\r\n            Solution:\r\n\r\n\r\nwords = terms (synonym)\r\nperverse = flag for anagram\r\nanagram of `terms' = MSTER\r\nthe first person = ADAM\r\nwithout = outside (!)\r\nADAM outside MSTER = AMSTERDAM\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Clue syntax deserves a more thorough examination\r\nthan space permits; but perhaps it would be best to\r\ncomment on some aspects of the ethics of compiling\r\nclues.\r\n\r\n            The first commandment in the puzzlers' bible\r\nreads: Thou shalt not waste words.  A well-constructed\r\nclue comprises only words necessary for conveying, in a\r\ndeceptive way, the information solvers require to find\r\nthe answer.  Adding fillers to distract them is considered\r\nunfair.  As for the answer, it is better to avoid very\r\nlearned or rare words unknown to all but a few lexicographers.\r\nThe idea is to test the solvers' skill in deciphering\r\nclues rather than their familiarity with the\r\nrecondite recesses of the lexicon.  (This being said, one\r\nBritish publication does offer a special obscure-words\r\npuzzle, probably for the benefit of glossarial masochists.\r\nLittle wonder it appears under the name of\r\nMephisto.)\r\n\r\n            On the other hand, it is admissible, as we have\r\nalready seen, to throw solvers off the scent with an\r\noccasional comma in the ?wrong? place.  The same\r\nholds for other dividers, such as colons, dashes, hyphens,\r\nand blanks.  Likewise, a bit of juggling with\r\napostrophes, quotation marks, and capitals is permitted,\r\nalways on the understanding that no punctuation\r\nor spelling rules are infringed.  And it goes without\r\nsaying that clue texts may be arranged in such a way\r\nthat, at first sight, certain words appear to belong to a\r\ndifferent inflectional form or word class than is actually\r\nthe case when the clue is unlocked.  In fact, this is\r\nan essential part of the fun.  This feature has already\r\nbeen demonstrated in the very first example (the cock\r\nthat crows) and also in clue F. Clue J offers two further\r\ninstances: at first reading, changed is suggestive of being\r\na past tense but after analysis it is identified as a\r\npast participle (serving as an anagram flag); likewise,\r\nquarterly shifts from adverb to noun.\r\n\r\n            Let us end with a specimen in which several of the\r\nabove techniques are represented:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               T.  \r\n               Part of his imprint appears in absurd Anglo-Saxon\r\nrules, word for word (6) = ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution: Replace in the second element (rules word\r\nfor word) the last three words by their synonym\r\n?verbatim.?

Submitted by\r\n.]\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Money of the Realm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            One of the privileges of national sovereignty is the\r\nright to name your country's money, or to rename\r\nit when the old name has acquired unpleasant\r\nassociations.  The tourist struggling at each border\r\ncrossing with exchanging one country's money for that\r\nof another and trying to fix values may not have the\r\ntime then to wonder why a country's money is called\r\nwhat it is.  [Because so many languages are involved,\r\nthe names that follow are as used in English language\r\npublications of the International Monetary Fund.]\r\n\r\n            Money originated in the form of coins.  For many\r\ncountries the current names of what is now mostly\r\npaper money are based on characteristics of the old\r\ncoins or refer to the fact that the weight of a silver or\r\ngold coin was often an indication of its value.  The\r\npound sterling (the money of the United Kingdom),\r\nfor example, apparently derived from a pound weight\r\nof silver pennies of the Norman period which had a\r\nstar on them (Old English: steorling `coin with a star').\r\nThe concept continues through the Spanish word for\r\n`weight': peso (Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican\r\nRepublic, Mexico, Philippines, Uruguay); its\r\ndiminutive: peseta (Spain), and the same word in Portuguese:\r\npeso (Guinea-Bissau).\r\n\r\n            The association of money names with other\r\nweights is common: ouguiya (Mauritania) means\r\n`ounce.'  Kyat (Burma) is the name for a measure of\r\n16.33 grams.  Baht (Thailand) is a weight of 15 grams.\r\nDrachma (Greece), which literally means a `handful,'\r\nis a weight of 3.2 grams.  Dirham (Morocco, United\r\nArab Emirates) derives from drachma .\r\n\r\n            As in the United Kingdom, the currency names of\r\nother economically powerful countries have long historical\r\nroots.  Franc (France) goes back to a 14th-century\r\ncoin inscribed ?Francorum rex,? `King of the\r\nFranks.'  Dollar (United States and some other countries)\r\nderives from the German Thaler , a coin of the\r\n16th century which was minted in silver from a mine in\r\nJoachimsthal.  The word dollar was used in 17th-century\r\nEngland to refer to the thaler and became the\r\nofficial name of the United States monetary unit by an\r\nAct of the Continental Congress, on July 6, 1785.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Denarius , a coin of ancient Rome, evolved into\r\ndinar , the name used by many countries of the eastern\r\nMediterrean which were once part of, or near, the\r\nancient Roman Empire (Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan,\r\nKuwait, Libya, People's Democratic Republic of\r\nYemen, Tunisia, Yugoslavia).  Denarius was the source\r\nof the abbreviation d for the former English penny.\r\nShilling , another coin in the predecimal pound sterling\r\nmay take its name from the Roman coin, solidus ,\r\nworth about 25 denarii.  It is the money name in\r\nKenya, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, and, spelt Schilling ,\r\nin Austria.  Metical (Mozambique) was a former\r\nArab unit of currency.  Dobra (S?o Tom? and Pr?n-\r\n\r\n            cipe), meaning `double,' is the name of a former Portuguese\r\ngold coin.  Pataca (Macau) stems from a 17th-century\r\nSpanish and Portuguese coin, the patacoon.\r\nKina (Papua New Guinea) originated from shell\r\nmoney used for centuries by people along their coast;\r\nthe cedi of Ghana means `small shell' after the former\r\nuse of the cowrie shell for money.  The complete panel\r\nof cloth formerly used for money is the meaning behind\r\ndalasi (The Gambia).\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Mark was a common term used throughout Europe\r\nfor a weight of silver or gold, usually about eight\r\nounces.  The name was adopted by Germany in 1875\r\nfor a coin to replace the thaler.  The Germans retained\r\nthe name even when its monetary value sank so low\r\nthat currency reform was necessary.  It was the reichsmark\r\nthat suffered through the hyperinflation of\r\n1922-23 when the cost of mailing a letter went from\r\none reichsmark to 40 billion in 17 months.  The rentenmark ,\r\nsecured by the industrial and agricultural\r\nresources of the country, was introduced in limited\r\namounts to stabilize the currency.  (This was the creation\r\nof the German financier and Central Banker,\r\nHjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht.)  The name continues\r\nin Deutsche mark (West Germany) and mark (East\r\nGermany).  When Brazil reformed its economy several\r\nyears ago, the former name of its currency was\r\nchanged from cruzeiro to cruzado , the meaning `little\r\ncross' to `crusade' being of less importance than the\r\nsimilarity of the names in Portuguese.\r\n\r\n            The names of some kinds of money are associated\r\nwith the metal originally used or some related feature.\r\n`Gold' is the meaning of guilder (Netherlands) and\r\nztoty (Poland).  The Sanskrit for `wrought silver' is the\r\nbasis for rupee (India, Pakistan, Seychelles, Sri\r\nLanka), rupiah (Indonesia), and rufiyaa (Maldives).\r\nBirr (Ethiopia) means `silver' and was the name used\r\nbeginning in the 18th century to designate the Maria\r\nTheresa thaler, an Austrian coin which circulated in\r\ncountries around the Red Sea.  Ringgit (Malaysia)\r\nmeans `serrated, milled,' a characteristic of the edging\r\non coins.  Kip (Laos) means `ingot.'  Ruble (Russia),\r\nwhich literally means `stump,' might have denoted a\r\npiece cut from a silver bar.\r\n\r\n            Some countries name their currency to honor people\r\nfamous in their history: bolivar (Venezuela) for the\r\nliberator of South America, Sim?n Bol?var; sucre\r\n(Ecuador) for Antonio Jos? de Sucre, chief lieutenant\r\nof Bol?var and liberator of what is now Ecuador at the\r\nbattle of Pichincha in 1822 near Quito; col?n (Costa\r\nRica, El Salvador) for Christopher Columbus; balboa\r\n(Panama) for Vasco N??ez de Balboa, discoverer of the\r\nPacific Ocean; lempira (Honduras) for the 16th-century\r\nIndian chief who is a national symbol of liberty\r\nand valor for resisting the Spanish advance; and c?rdoba\r\n(Nicaragua) for Francisco Hern?ndez de C?r\r\ndoba, first acting governor.  Both Balboa and C?rdoba\r\nwere deputies of the Spanish governor in Panama, Pedro\r\nArias Da\\?\\ila, who subsequently executed them.\r\nThe regional characteristic of using the same idea\r\nas a basis for selecting a currency name is apparent\r\nfrom these South and Central American neighboring\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n            It is true also in Scandinavia where the money\r\nname is crown: krona (Sweden, Iceland), krone (Norway,\r\nDenmark).  The only non-Scandinavian ?crown?\r\nis koruna (Czechoslovakia).  Regional patterns emerge\r\nelsewhere: in northern Asia the money names mean\r\n`round, circular': yen (Japan), won (Korea), tugrik\r\n(Mongolia), and yuan (People's Republic of China).  In\r\nthe last, the currency name is actually renminbi , `people's\r\nmoney,' with the unit of account being the yuan .\r\nThe meaning `royal' appears as riyal (Saudi Arabia,\r\nQatar), rial (Iran, Oman, Yemen Arab Republic), and\r\nfurther south as lilangeni (Swaziland).\r\n\r\n            History and myth provide another source for\r\nnames.  Shekel (Israel) was a Babylonian weight which\r\nbecame the coin of the Hebrews.  [Exodus 30:13 ?This\r\nthey shall give...half a shekel after the shekel of the\r\nsanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs) and half shekel\r\nshall be the offering of the Lord.?]  Taka (Bangladesh),\r\nliterally `money,' derives from tonka of the old Persian\r\nlanguage which was the money of the 16th-century\r\nMughal empire in circulation in what was then Bengal.\r\nInti (Peru) was the sun god in the ancient Peruvian\r\nreligion; Peru's previous money was sol , Spanish for\r\n`sun.'  Rand (South Africa) is the now common name\r\nfor the witwatersrand , the site of the great gold fields\r\nfound in the late 19th century and the original source\r\nof its wealth.\r\n\r\n            For most countries the easiest source of a name for\r\ntheir money has been to take that of another country,\r\neither because of proximity and association with a\r\nstrong economic country or because of a former colonial\r\nrelationship.  Thus, Belgium, Switzerland, and\r\nLuxembourg use franc ; Canada and The Bahamas\r\nchoose dollar .\r\n\r\n            The name dollar is used by sixteen more countries:\r\nAustralia, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Brunei, Fiji,\r\nGuyana, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Liberia, New Zealand,\r\nSingapore, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, Trinidad and\r\nTobago, and Zimbabwe.  As the East Caribbean dollar ,\r\nit is used by several small countries who do not have\r\ntheir own money: Antigua, Dominica, Grenada, St.\r\nChristopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n            The name pound is used by Cyprus, Egypt, Ireland\r\n(as punt ), Lebanon, Sudan, and Syria.  Lira (Italy,\r\nMalta, Turkey) is a contracted form of the Latin\r\nword for `pound' libra.  Mark traveled as markka to\r\nFinland.\r\n\r\n            The names franc and guilder spread only to their\r\nformer colonial areas.  The franc appears in Burundi,\r\nComoros, Djibouti, French Guiana, Guinea, Malagasy,\r\nRwanda, and as a common currency of the CFA\r\n(Communaut? Francaise Africaine), comprising Benin,\r\nBurkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Central African\r\nRepublic, C?te d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon,\r\nMali, Niger, People's Republic of the Congo, Senegal,\r\nand Togo.  Guilder is used in Netherlands Antilles and\r\nSuriname.\r\n\r\n            Money has also derived its names from things or\r\nanimals.  Lev (Bulgaria) and leu (Romania) mean\r\n`lion.'  Escudo (Portugal, Cape Verde) means `shield.'\r\nQuetzal (Guatemala) is the national bird and guarani\r\n(Paraguay) the name of an Indian tribe.  Forint (Hungary)\r\nmeans `flower,' pula (Botswana) `rain,' austral\r\n(Argentina) `southern,' and kwanza (Angola) `first.'\r\nKwacha (Malawi, Zambia) means `dawn' in reference\r\nto the ?dawn of freedom.?  Tala (Western Samoa) is\r\nderived from dollar , while pa'anga was selected by\r\nTonga.  As reported in The N.Y. Times , ?Tonga has\r\ndecided against calling its new decimal currency unit\r\nthe dollar because the native word tola also means a\r\n`pig's snout,' the `soft end of a coconut,' or, in vulgar\r\nlanguage, a `mouth.'  The new unit...has only two\r\nalternative meanings--a `coin-shaped seed' and, not\r\nsurprisingly, `money.' ?\r\n\r\n            When no other source seems suitable, nations\r\nname their money after the country.  Naira (Nigeria) is\r\nderived from the country's name as is probably Vatu\r\n(Vanuatu).  More direct is afghani (Afghanistan), leone\r\n(Sierra Leone), and the ultimate in directness, zaire\r\n(Zaire).\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            English Is A Crazy Language\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            English is the most widely spoken language in the\r\nhistory of our planet.  English has acquired the\r\nlargest vocabulary and inspired one of the noblest bodies\r\nof literature in the annals of the human race.\r\n\r\n            Nonetheless, English is a crazy language.  In the\r\ncrazy English language, the blackbird hen is brown,\r\nblackboards can be blue or green, and blackberries are\r\ngreen and red before they are ripe.  To add to this\r\ninsanity, there is no butter in buttermilk , no egg in\r\neggplant , neither worms nor wood in wormwood , and\r\nno ham in a hamburger .  (In fact, if somebody invented\r\na sandwich consisting of a ham patty in a bun, we\r\nwould have a hard time finding a name for it.)  And we\r\ndiscover more culinary madness in the revelations that\r\nEnglish muffins weren't invented in England, French\r\nfries in France, or Danish pastries in Denmark.  In this\r\nweird English language, greyhounds aren't always\r\ngrey (or gray), a ladybug is a beetle, guinea pigs are\r\nneither pigs nor from Guinea, and a titmouse is neither\r\nmammal nor mammaried.\r\n\r\n            Language is like the air we breathe.  It is invisible,\r\ninescapable, and indispensable; yet we take it for\r\ngranted.  But when we take time to explore the vagaries\r\nof English, we find that hot dogs can be cold, darkrooms\r\ncan be lit, nightmares can take place in broad\r\ndaylight, midwives can be men, hours--especially\r\nhappy hours and rush hours--can last longer than\r\nsixty minutes, ice cubes can be noncubic, tablecloths\r\ncan be made of paper, silverware can be made of\r\nplastic, most telephones are dialed by being punched\r\n(or pushed?), and most bathrooms don't have any\r\nbaths.  In fact, a dog can go to the bathroom under a\r\ntree--no bath, no room--it is still ?going to the bathroom.?\r\n\r\n            \r\nWhy is it that a woman can man a station, but a\r\nman cannot ?woman? one, that a man can father a\r\nmovement, but a woman cannot ?mother? one, and\r\nthat a king rules a kingdom , but a queen does not rule\r\na ?queendom??  A writer is someone who writes, and a\r\nstinger is something that stings.  But fingers do not\r\n?fing,? grocers ?groce,? hammers ?ham,? or humdingers\r\n?humding.?  If the plural of mouse is mice , why\r\ndon't we live in ?hice??  One tooth , two teeth ; so why\r\nnot one booth , two ?beeth??  One index , two indices --one\r\nKleenex , two ?Kleenices??  If someone rang a\r\nbell , why don't we say that she also ?flang? a ball?  If\r\nshe wrote a letter, perhaps she also ?bote? her tongue.\r\nIf the teacher taught , why isn't it also true that the\r\npreacher ?praught??  If she conceives a conception and\r\nreceives at a reception , why didn't she grieve a ?greption?\r\nand believe a ?beleption??\r\n\r\n            If a horsehair mat is made from the hair of horses\r\nand a camel's hair brush from the hair of camels, from\r\nwhat is a mohair coat made?  If a vegetarian eats vegetables,\r\nwhat does a humanitarian eat?  If pro and con\r\nare opposites, is congress the opposite of progress ?\r\n\r\n            In this confusing language of ours noisome doesn't\r\nmean `noisy,' meretricious is anything but meritorious,\r\npenultimate is less ultimate than ultimate , but invaluable\r\nis more valuable than valuable .\r\n\r\n            No wonder that we English speakers are constantly\r\nstanding meaning on its head.  We delete negatives\r\nand say, I could care less , when we really mean, `I\r\ncouldn't care less,' and we add gratuitous negatives\r\nand say, I miss not seeing her , when we really mean, `I\r\nmiss seeing her.'  Any book that keeps us literallly glued\r\nto our seat actually keeps us figuratively glued to our\r\nseat, a near miss (which is a`collision') is a `near hit,'\r\nsomething that falls between the cracks would in reality\r\nland on the planks or the concrete, a big traffic\r\nbottleneck is a `small bottleneck,' and a hot cup of\r\ncoffee is really a `cup of hot coffee.'  We get up in the\r\nmorning and put on our shoes and socks and then go\r\nback and forth .  No, we put on our socks and shoes and\r\nthen go forth and back .\r\n\r\n            Because English speakers seem to have our heads\r\nscrewed on backwards, they constantly misperceive\r\ntheir bodies.  They fall head over heels in love when we\r\nreally mean heels over head in love.  If they are disappointed\r\nor afraid, they try to keep a stiff upper lip\r\nwhen it is the lower lip they are trying to control.  They\r\ncomplain that things are being done behind their\r\nbacks , but nothing can be done ?in front of their\r\nbacks.?  And they try to avoid doing things ass back-wards\r\nwhen `ass backwards' is the only way that anyone\r\ncan do anything.\r\n\r\n            Sometimes you have to believe that all English\r\nspeakers should be committed to an asylum.  In what\r\nother language do people drive in a parkway and park\r\nin a driveway ?  In what other language can the\r\nweather be hot as hell one day and cold as hell the\r\nnext?  In what other language can quite a lot and quite\r\nfew mean the same thing, as well as loosen and unloosen,\r\nravel and unravel, passive and impassive,\r\nflammable and inflammable, shameful and shameless\r\n(behavior) and What won't he do next ?  and What will\r\nhe do next ?  In what other language are overlook and\r\noversee opposites but a slim chance and a fat chance\r\nthe same?  Why is it easier to assent than to dissent but\r\nharder to ascend than to descend ?  Is it really true that\r\nif you decide to be `bad forever,' you have chosen to be\r\nbad for good , and if you are wearing only your right\r\nshoe, your right one is left.  Right?\r\n\r\n            When the sun or moon or stars are out they are\r\nvisible, but when the lights are out , they are invisible.\r\nA piece of cloth that wear may be the same as a piece\r\nof cloth that won't wear .  Trimming a tree may involve\r\ncutting it away or, especially around Christmas, adding\r\nto it .  When we wind up a watch, we `start' it, but\r\nwhen I wind up this disquisition, I shall `end' it.\r\n\r\n            Does it not seem just a little bizarre that we can\r\nmake amends but never just one ?amend?; that no\r\nmatter how carefully we comb through history, we can\r\nnever discover just one ?annal?; that, sifting through\r\nthe wreckage of a disaster, we can never find just one\r\n?smithereen?; and that we never contract a single\r\n?heebie-jeebie??  Which reminds me to ask a burning\r\nlinguistic question.  If you have a bunch of odds and\r\nends and you get rid of or sell off all but one of them,\r\nwhat is left?\r\n\r\n            What do you make of the fact that we can talk only\r\nabout the nonexistence, never the existence, of certain\r\nitems and concepts?  Have you ever run into someone\r\nwho was ?combobulated,? ?chalant,? ?sheveled,? ?gruntled,?\r\nor ?gainly??  We all know people who are no\r\nspring chickens , but where, pray tell, are the people\r\nwho are ?spring chickens??  Have you ever met someone\r\nwho was ?great shakes,? who could ?cut the mustard?\r\nand ?do squat,? who ?was your cup of tea,? and whom\r\nyou ?would touch with a ten-foot pole??  Do you know\r\nanyone who is a ?slouch? or ?would hurt a fly??\r\n\r\n            If the truth be told, all languages are a little\r\ncrazy.  As Walt Whitman might proclaim, they contradict\r\nthemselves.  That is because language is invented,\r\nnot discovered, and, as such, language reflects the creativity\r\nand fearful asymmetry of the human mind.  In\r\nhis essay ?The Awful German Language,? Mark Twain\r\nspoofs the confusion engendered by German gender by\r\ntranslating from a conversation in a German Sunday\r\nschool book:\r\n\r\n\r\nGRETCHEN: Wilhelm, where is the turnip?\r\nWILHELM: She has gone to the kitchen.\r\nGRETCHEN: Where is the accomplished and beautiful\r\nEnglish maiden?\r\n            \r\n\r\n            WILHELM: It has gone to the opera.  Twain continues:\r\n?a tree is male, its buds are female, its leaves are\r\nneuter; horses are sexless, dogs are male, cats are female--tomcats\r\nincluded.?\r\n\r\n            Still, you have to wonder about the crazy English\r\nlanguage, in which your house can burn up and burn\r\ndown at the same time, in which you fill in a form by\r\nfilling out a form, in which you add up a column of\r\nfigures by adding them down , in which your alarm\r\nclock goes off by going on , and in which you first chop\r\ndown a tree--and then chop up a tree.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Foreign Correspondents\r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\nIt all began with Lenin.  The Russian Revolution,\r\nthe Soviet Union, and journalistic expertise devoted\r\nto these supremely important phenomena of the\r\ntwentieth century began with Vladimir Ilich Lenin.\r\nBut as far as American journalism is concerned, that\r\npronouncement is not quite correct, because more often\r\nthan not American journalists began and for an\r\nembarrassingly long time continued not with Vladimir\r\nor Ilich (as the founding Bolshevik is sometime affectionately\r\ncalled, peasant-fashion by his patronymic)\r\nbut with Nikolai Lenin.  The error flawed the record\r\nbeyond newspaper reporting.  For example, The Columbia\r\nEncyclopedia , in an edition last copyrighted in\r\n1940, has an appropriately long entry for ?the founder\r\nof the USSR? under Lenin, Nikolai .  How this mistake\r\ncame about in the first place no one is certain.  Lenin\r\ndid use the pseudonym N. Lenin , among scores of\r\nothers, and maybe a self-styled authority assumed that\r\nthe N . stood for Nikolai , a name that may have been\r\nsuggested by that of the Russian emperor.  In European\r\ncontinental usage the letter N , corresponding to X in\r\nthe English-speaking world, is sometimes used for a\r\nname an author does not wish to reveal.  At any rate,\r\nthe mistake, trivial in itself, tended to discredit a good\r\ndeal of American reporting about the Soviet Union\r\namong people who knew better.  After all, if the bourgeois\r\npress could not get even Lenin's name right, how\r\nreliable was it about anything else in the USSR?\r\n\r\n            Decades later the leadership of the Communist\r\nParty of the Soviet Union was assumed by Nikita\r\nSergeevich Khrushchev.  By then Kremlinology had\r\nmatured and the American press had all of Khrushchev's\r\nnames right, though there were several ways to\r\ntransliterate and pronounce them in English.  To the\r\nhorror of some Western readers, however, he was at\r\nleast once quoted out of context as having threatened\r\nto ?bury? America.  And he did say that.  But the Russian\r\nverb he used in a sentence that was more a bellicose\r\nboast than a threat was pokhoronit', which means\r\n`bury,' all right, but in the sense of the verb in ?we\r\nburried Grandma last week.?  When Nikita Sergeevich\r\nbragged that the USSR would bury the USA, he meant\r\nthat technologically and economically the Soviets\r\nwould leave us in the dust, would be around for our\r\nfuneral, not that they would put us six feet under.\r\n\r\n            If our press would attain true excellence in selecting\r\nEnglish expressions to correspond to Russian originals,\r\nit should exercise more care about designating\r\nthe Soviet Union as ?Russia? and Soviets as ?Russians.?\r\nRussia, now the RSFSR (for Russian Soviet Federated\r\nSocialist Republic) is only one of several Soviet republics,\r\nwhich are more like states of the United States\r\nthan what we generally mean by ?republic,? and Russians\r\n(sometimes redundantly called ?ethnic Russians?)\r\nmake up only about half of the population of the\r\nUSSR.  So referring to the USSR as ?Russia? is a mistake\r\non the order of calling the United Kingdom or\r\nGreat Britain ?England.?  However, the boundaries of\r\nthe tsar's empire, for centuries known as ?Russia,? were\r\napproximately the same as those of the Soviet Union; it\r\nwas occasionally known as ?the Russias,? as in the formula\r\n?Tsar of all the Russias?; thus, this particular\r\nconfusion comes naturally.  Gorbachev himself is said\r\nto have had to apologize while making a speech in the\r\nUkraine when he referred to the Ukraine as ?Russian.?\r\nThis faux pas might be likened to the Queen of England's\r\nsaying in an address before Welsh miners, ?As we\r\nhere in England well know ...?\r\n\r\n            The problem of drawing a distinction between\r\nRussians and citizens of the USSR has been solved by\r\nborrowing the word Soviet into English as an adjective\r\nor a noun meaning a person and not an institution,\r\nexcept rarely as in the designation Supreme Soviet .  In\r\nRussian Sov?t means basically `counsel' and `council'\r\nand by extension `assembly'.  It never means a `citizen of\r\nthe USSR' or any other kind of person in Russian,\r\nthough its adjectival derivative sovetskii can be used\r\nsubstantively alone or followed by chelovek `person,' to\r\nmean a `Soviet person.'  So the English word Soviet\r\ncorresponds to both the Russian noun sov?t or much\r\nmore often to the Russian adjective sovetskii in their\r\nmany inflected forms.\r\n\r\n            Currently two Russian words are challenging\r\ncorrespondents, among others, to find English\r\nequivalents: perestroika and glasnost '.  The first of\r\nthese Gorbachevian buzzwords can be handily calqued\r\ninto English as `restructuring.'  Glasnost ', though, is\r\nmore difficult.  As a calque it would come into English\r\nas vocalness , which is no word.  It is not a new word in\r\nRussian.  The 1935 edition of the four-volume Tolkovyi\r\nSlovar' Russkogo Yazyka (`Explanatory Dictionary of\r\nthe Russian Language') defines glasnost' as: ?Accessibility\r\nto public discussion and evaluation; publicity.?  I\r\ncan think of no single English word that quite corresponds\r\nto this definition.  Publicity perhaps comes closest.\r\nBut since both perestroika and glasnost' from our\r\npoint of view do not mean `restructuring' and `publicity'\r\ngenerally, as the English words do to us, but rather\r\nrefer to reforms specifically initiated by Gorbachev,\r\nthe Russian words, particularly glasnost', are usually\r\nborrowed into English unaltered (except in pronunciation).\r\nThere are, of course, precedents for this sort of\r\nintact borrowing: pogrom, ukase, intelligentsia , and\r\nmuzhik for example.  And in the same way Russian\r\nspeakers have helped themselves to our sex, jazz,\r\nlynch , and business .\r\n\r\n            Apropos of Gorbachev--and Khrushchev too for\r\nthat matter--those es in their names pose a problem of\r\nphonetic correspondence.  Though usually written in\r\nRussian like any other e , just as in English, they are\r\npronounced like os .  Sometimes in textbooks for children\r\nand beginners such es are marked in Russian with\r\ntwo dots over them; they are sometimes transliterated\r\ninto English as os , so that occasionally you will see the\r\nspelling Gorbachov , which in my opinion is preferable.\r\nThen another variant in transliteration is\r\n-ov/-off, -ev/-eff .  The name ending in double f for\r\nwhat in Russian is invariably v is seldom seen nowadays;\r\nbut a few decades ago or in documents or books\r\nwritten then you might have seen the two Soviet leaders'\r\nnames transliterated Gorbacheff or Gorbachoff\r\n            \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Lite/Light\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            For approximately a thousand years, the word\r\nlight has been used to describe beer and wine\r\ncontaining less alcohol than regular beer and wine:\r\n\r\n\r\nc 1000 Ags. Voc. in Wr.- Willcker 282/6\r\nMelle dulci, leoht beor.  (Oxford English\r\nDictionary)\r\nc 1000 Sax. Leechd. III. 122 Drince leoht wyn.\r\n(OED)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Currently, however, many a denizen of the United\r\nStates regards light (also spelled lite ) as a label that\r\nindicates that a beer is lower in calories than its nonlight\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n            and Khrushcheff or Khrushchoff .  I have seen both the\r\n-ov and - off transliterations on the same page of a\r\nbook.  The reason for this variation is that when the\r\nCyrillic letter that represents our English v -sound is\r\nfinal in a word, as in the nominative case for\r\nGorbachev , it is unvoiced and sounds like f (or ff for\r\ngood measure); when an inflectional ending is added,\r\nas in Gorbacheva (the genitive case), that same letter\r\nis voiced, like v .\r\n\r\n            Such variations in transliteration are practically\r\nendless, and hardly any variation can be called an\r\nerror, though consistency is obviously desirable.  The\r\nmost troublesome inconsistencies in transliteration\r\nseem to be owing either to the human tendency to\r\nconceal doubt behind abundance or to multiple naturalizations\r\nas the name migrates across Europe.  For\r\ninstance, in English the name of the Russian composer\r\nis usually spelled Tchaikovsky and sometimes as\r\nTschaikovsky or Tschaikowsky where three or four\r\nEnglish letters are used to represent a sound represented\r\nby a single Russian letter and more normally by\r\nonly two in English, ch .  The name Chaliapin was first\r\ntransliterated into a French spelling Chaliapine ; later,\r\nwhen most of the family moved to the United States,\r\nthe e was dropped to Anglicize the spelling.  This was a\r\nconfusing half measure, however; the initial ch remained\r\nas in the French spelling, representing a Russian\r\nletter borrowed from the Hebrew alphabet for the\r\nsound represented in English by sh .  As a result, many\r\nAmericans innocently mispronounce the name of the\r\ngreat operatic bass and his descendants.  A certain Tennessean,\r\nwho became a good friend of Boris Chaliapin,\r\nthe Time cover artist, got off on the wrong foot\r\nwhen he heard the artist's name as Charley Apin .\r\nSince Boris was too polite to correct the Tennessean,\r\nand others who knew better found the mistake too\r\namusing to rectify, that one American friend called\r\nBoris good ol' Charley Apin as long as the friend lived.\r\n\r\n            The roots of the `reduced calorie' meaning of\r\nlite/light go back to 1967.  In that year Meister Brau\r\nInc. of Chicago initially marketed Meister Brau Lite, a\r\nreduced-calorie beer.  Women were targeted as the primary\r\nconsumers; but the beer, which was promoted as\r\na diet drink, was not very successful.  In 1972, Phillip\r\nMorris, Inc.'s Miller Brewing Co. acquired the Lite\r\nbeer label in a buyout of Meister Brau Inc. Miller Lite\r\nwas introduced to test markets in 1973; and the first\r\nLite commercial, which featured Super Bowl hero\r\nMatt Snell, aired in July of that year.  The tenth Lite\r\ncommercial, which featured linebacker Dick Butkus,\r\nwas shot in May 1975 just as Miller Lite was going\r\nnational.\r\n\r\n            Miller Lite commercials were designed to convince\r\nyoung males that it is all right to drink light beer.\r\nConsequently, these commercials, which, according to\r\nVideo Storyboard Tests Inc., are among the most popular\r\never to be shown on television, have featured former\r\nathletes (e.g., Bubba Smith, Bob Uecker, and Rosie\r\nGrier) and celebrities (e.g., author Mickey Spillane,\r\ndrummer Buddy Rich, and comedian Rodney Dangerfield).\r\nThe original theme of these commercials was:\r\n?Everything you always wanted in a light--and less.?\r\n\r\n            During the early years that Miller was convincing\r\nthe public that tough guys do drink light beer, other\r\nbreweries remained skeptical.  Because they thought\r\nlight beer had a wimpy image, they stayed out of the\r\nlight beer market for a while.  When other breweries\r\nfinally did enter the market, most of them used the\r\nspelling l-i-g-h-t: Bud Light, Coors Light, Michelob\r\nLight, Natural Light, Old Milwaukee Light, Stroh\r\nLight .  The reason for this was simple enough: Miller\r\nBrewing Co. owned the trademark Lite , which it had\r\npurchased from Meister Brau Inc. in 1972.  However,\r\nbrewer Paul Kalmanovitz, owner of Falstaff Brewing\r\nCo. of Omaha and General Brewing Co. of Vancouver,\r\nWashington, challenged Miller's exclusive right to\r\nLite .  In July 1982, a U.S. District Court jury in San\r\nFrancisco ruled that Lite was just an alternate spelling\r\nof Light .  As a result of this decision, Lite may now be\r\nused on the label of any beer to indicate that it is a\r\nreduced-calorie beer.\r\n\r\n            According to The Wall Street Journal (April 20,\r\n1988) light beers represent approximately 22 percent of\r\nthe $13 billion beer market.  The popularity of reduced-calorie\r\nbeers has resulted in the inclusion of the following\r\ndefinition of lite/light in The Random House Dictionary\r\nof the English Language, Second Unabridged\r\nEdition : ?13. (of alcoholic beverages)... (esp. of beer\r\nand wine) having fewer calories and usually a lower\r\nalcohol content than the standard product.?\r\n\r\n            Not all light beers are created equal, however.\r\nSome have fewer calories than others: Michelob Light,\r\n134 calories per 12-ounce serving; Stroh Light, 115;\r\nBudweiser Light, 108; Miller Lite, 96; Pabst Extra\r\nLight, 70; and Pearl Lite, 68.  As we can see, Michelob\r\nLight has almost twice as many calories as Pearl Lite.\r\nIn fact, Michelob Light has one calorie more (i.e.,\r\n134) than Heidelberg regular beer (133 calories).\r\n\r\n            Since 1978, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and\r\nFirearms has been involved in rule-making regarding\r\nthe use of lite/light as a label for alcoholic beverages.\r\nJim Ficaretta of the BATF has stated that, according\r\nto the current ruling, if lite/light in the sense `reduced\r\ncalorie' is applied to a malt beverage, the label on that\r\nproduct must contain a statement of average analysis\r\nwith regard to calories, carbohydrates, fat and protein.\r\nIf lite/light simply describes a characteristic of\r\nthe beer (e.g., taste, body, color), no such statement is\r\nrequired.  The last word on this matter has not been\r\nwritten, however.  A decade after it first became involved\r\nin the lite/light issue, the BATF , with several\r\n\r\n            proposals on hand, is still working on rule-making\r\nwith regard to the use of lite/light as a label for malt\r\nbeverages, wines, and spirits.\r\n\r\n            The barons of beerdom are not the only merchants\r\nto have produced reduced-calorie ingestibles.  A\r\nplethora of reduced-calorie foods are also available for\r\nthe weight-conscious among us.  Where food products\r\nare concerned, however, no one has ever held the exclusive\r\nright to lite .  Therefore, both lite and light have\r\nbeen freely used in the names of products: e.g., Prince\r\nLight Spaghetti, Aunt Jemima Lite Syrup, Thank You\r\nLight Pie Filling, Whitman's Lite Chocolates, Wonder\r\nLight Buns , and even Alpo Lite Dog Food .  Such products\r\noften have one third fewer calories than their nonlight\r\ncounterparts, although that proportion might\r\nvary.\r\n\r\n            Health-conscious Americans are concerned not\r\nonly with calories.  They also want less caffeine in their\r\ncoffee, less salt in their pickles, less sodium in their\r\nsalt, no sugar added to their canned fruits, and less tar\r\nin their cigarettes.  Consequently, those merchants who\r\npander to and even help create our wants and needs\r\nhave provided us with, to name but a few, the following\r\nlite/light products: Manor House Lite Coffee with\r\none third less caffeine than regular coffee; Piper's\r\nFarms Lite Kosher Dills with 50 percent less salt than\r\nPiper's Farm regular dill pickles; Morton Lite Salt with\r\nhalf the sodium of regular table salt; Libby's Lite\r\nPears, Peaches, Mixed Fruits , and Fruit Cocktail , all\r\nof which have no sugar added; Pall Mall Light 100's\r\nwith one third less tar than ?the leading filter king-sized\r\ncigarette.?\r\n\r\n            Gregory Weismantel, president of Manor House\r\nFoods, has stated: ? Lite is perceived by consumers as a\r\nname of a product that has less of a negative ingredient?\r\n( Chicago Tribune , November 4, 1981).  His statement\r\nforeshadowed a new definition of lite/light that\r\nsix years later appeared in Random House II : ?12. low\r\nin any substance, as sugar, starch, or tars, that is considered\r\nharmful or undesirable: light cigarettes .?\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Lite/Light , when applied to a food, may refer to\r\nthe product's taste, color, or texture rather than to the\r\nnumber of calories or the amount of fat, salt, sugar, or\r\ncholesterol it contains.  For example, in 1982, Frito-Lay\r\nintroduced Light Corn Chips , which were thinner\r\nand crispier than Frito-Lay's regular corn chips but\r\nwhich had just as much salt and a few more calories\r\nthan the regular product.  In order to avoid confusion,\r\nFrito-Lay subsequently changed the name to Crisp 'N\r\nThin Corn Chips .  Not all manufacturers of food products\r\nare as concerned about customer confusion, however.\r\nRep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) has observed: ?[Food\r\ncompanies] strain the limits of the English language\r\nand our patience by overusing words such as...\r\nlight .  The more we distort the language, the less the\r\nconsumer can understand the product? ( Chicago SunTimes ,\r\nOctober 19, 1986).\r\n\r\n            In an effort to shed some light on the use of\r\nlite/light , Rep. Cooper introduced in February 1986 a\r\nbill that would have limited the use of lite/light to\r\nproducts that have one third fewer calories, one half\r\nless fat, or three fourths less sodium than regular (i.e.,\r\nnonlight) products.  This bill was lost in the legislative\r\nshuffle, however, and, as of this writing (October 25,\r\n1988), has yet to be passed in spite of having been\r\nreintroduced in 1987 and 1988.  The bill, which, in its\r\ncurrent form, would require a product labeled\r\nlite/light to have one third fewer calories, one third less\r\nfat, or one third less sodium than regular, nonlight\r\nproducts, will have to be introduced once again in\r\n1989.  Perhaps the fourth time will be a charm.\r\n\r\n            Potables, comestibles, and smokables are not the\r\nonly products to bear the lite/light designation.  In\r\n1982, Hallmark introduced a series of greeting cards\r\nthat contained puns.  They were called LITE and were\r\ndescribed as being ?a third less serious than regular\r\ngreeting cards.?  This description was, of course, an\r\nallusion to the solecism that has been used to promote\r\nMiller Lite: ?Lite has a third less calories than their\r\nregular beer.?  In 1986, the Johnson's Wax people introduced\r\nGlade Light , an aerosol air freshener with less\r\nthan half the perfume of regular sprays.  In the same\r\nyear, Jhirmack introduced Lite Shampoo, Lite Conditioner ,\r\nand Lite Mousse , which are designed to clean,\r\ncondition, and style one's hair without build-up.\r\n\r\n            The use of lite/light has extended beyond product\r\nnames.  In such cases, the term may be used in a\r\ndescriptive sense to indicate that something is less intense\r\nthan its nonlight counterpart.  Often, however,\r\nlite/light is used humorously, or even caustically.\r\n\r\n            Low-impact aerobics have been called lite aerobics .\r\nIn music, there are Lite Rock and Lite FM .  Book\r\neditor Henry Kisor used the term Lite Mystery to refer\r\nto a book ?with only half the calories of a regular\r\nwhodunit? ( Chicago Sun-Times , July 24, 1987).  Regarding\r\nThe Harvard Lampoon parody of USA Today ,\r\npublisher Joe Armstrong declared, ?We're kind of like\r\nUSA Today Lite ? ( USA Today , September 15, 1986).\r\nNewsweek Lite is what one critic called People Weekly\r\n( Chicago Tribune , January 20, 1988).  Picture Week ,\r\nwhich died after two extensive market tests by Time\r\nInc., was called People Lite by some skeptics at Time\r\nInc. because the publication was designed for those\r\nwho think there is too much to read in People (New\r\nYork , January 6, 1986).  The television show West 57th\r\nwas called ?CBS' lite news show? by People's TV critic,\r\nJeff Jarvis ( People Weekly , September 9, 1985).\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Lite College is what Stanley Mieses proffered the\r\nstudent who ?seeks an education that is tasteful without\r\nbeing fulfilling [and] degrees [that are] based on a\r\ncurriculum that is one third less challenging? ( The\r\nAtlantic , October 1983).  The Lite Fight , which consists\r\nof ?a simple opener and a swift final blow,? is\r\nwhat columnist Judy Markey offered the couple who\r\nwant to save time with a pared-down version of the\r\n?fundamental, tedious, classic argument? ( Chicago\r\nSun-Times , July 10, 1986).\r\n\r\n            In the political arena, Gary Hart, who tried so\r\ndesperately to emulate the late John F. Kennedy, was\r\ncalled ?the Kennedy lite candidate? ( Chicago Tribune ,\r\nJanuary 20, 1988).  Robert Dole had the title New Dole\r\nLite bestowed upon him because he was perceived to\r\nbe ?less acerbic [and] more personal [ sic ]? than he\r\npreviously had been ( Time , November 16, 1987).\r\n\r\n            A metaphor for our time.  That, according to some\r\nbehavioral scientists, is what lite/light has become in\r\nthe years since the first Miller Lite commercial aired in\r\nJuly 1973.  These concerned sociologists and psychologists\r\nmaintain that we Americans want not only beer\r\nthat is low in calories, cigarettes that are low in tar,\r\nand foods that are low in substances such as salt, sugar,\r\nfat, and cholesterol; we also want reduced-effort cures\r\nfor our ailments, reduced-work jobs, and reduced-commitment\r\nrelationships.  That is why these specialists\r\nin human behavior have declared the 80s to be the\r\nLite/Light Decade .\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n?State of Washington charges for certified birth, death,\r\nmarriage or disillusions....?

The\r\nprice has increased from $10.95 to $24.95 and it would\r\nappear that four pages have been added.  I commented\r\nthen that Mata Hari and Judge Roy Bean were both in\r\nbut that Doc Holliday was missing: Holliday is still on\r\nvacation and now the old Bean has joined him.  I commented\r\nthen that French vache `cop' had been omitted\r\nfrom the foreign supplement: it is still missing.  The\r\nentry for big boy tomato , on which I had commented,\r\nis no longer there, though big boy `heroin' is there.\r\n\r\n            It is difficult to compare the two editions.  Though\r\nthe dust-jacket blurb promises that 1500 new terms\r\nwere added, it is not easy to see where, and if, in order\r\nto fit them in, hundreds of entries were deleted, that\r\ndiminishes the value of the book.  There is no reason to\r\nassume that a 1982 book of 231 pp. selling for $10.95\r\nshould yield a 1988 book of 550pp. at $24.95, but one\r\nmight have expected more: in light of the information\r\nthat inflation over the past six years has averaged about\r\n3%, one might expect the same book to cost as much\r\nas $13.95 today, even allowing for a 1.7% increase in\r\nits length (4 pages).  For $24.95 we ought to have the\r\n1500 new entries and the old ones besides (revised, as\r\nnecessary).  If you have the 1982 edition, I see no justification\r\nfor buying the new one merely to line the\r\npublisher's pockets.\r\n\r\n            Laurence Urdang\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            The Dictionary of Gambling & Gaming\r\n\r\n            The language of gambling and gaming might be\r\nclassified as a blend of slang and jargon: the former\r\nseems almost obvious; the latter cannot be denied because\r\nthere are so many technical terms involved.  The\r\nauthor, Professor of English and Linguistics at the University\r\nof Nevada (Las Vegas--where else?), former\r\npresident of the American Dialect Society, erstwhile\r\nfield researcher for DARE and contributor to many\r\njournals (including VERBATIM, mentioned on p. xiii but\r\nignored by whoever wrote the dust-jacket blurb, presumably\r\nbecause it was not deemed to be among the\r\n?important? ones), has spent many years compiling\r\nthis dictionary.  The book is done ?on historical principles?--that\r\nis, it relies for its defining and other evidence\r\non citations drawn from a great many\r\nsources--and it is all the more interesting for that.\r\n\r\n            The ordinary entry is structured to show the headword\r\nor phrase, in boldface, followed by an italicized\r\npart-of-speech label, followed by the definition, then\r\nthe source or sources.  The really good stuff shows up,\r\nthough, when citations are given, for many of them\r\nare lively:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n?A? card, n. A certificate issued by a law-enforcement\r\nagency indicating security clearance\r\nfor a casino employee.  See also 50 CARD and SHERIFF'S\r\nCARD.\r\n\r\n1963 Taylor Las Vegas 100.  No inside man can work\r\non the Strip without the county's ?50? card, or\r\ndowntown without the city's ?A? card, signifying\r\nclearance.\r\n\r\n1983 Clark Oral Coll.  We used to call a work permit\r\nan A card, but since Metro was formed [Las\r\nVegas Metropolitan Police, combining city and\r\ncounty police], we just call it and the fifty card a\r\nsheriff's card.\r\n\r\none hand on the dice, n. phr.  In bank craps, a\r\ncommand from the stickman or boxman to a player\r\nto pick up and throw the dice with a\r\nsingle hand.  Compare NO DICE and NO ROLL.\r\n1984 Martinet Oral Coll.  The house doesn't want\r\na shooter to use two hands in handling the dice.\r\nIt's too easy to pull a switch.  If somebody uses\r\ntwo hands, like cupping the hands and blowing\r\non the dice, the stick or somebody will yell,\r\n?one hand on the dice, shooter.?  If there's\r\nanything suspicious about the move, the stick\r\nwill kill the dice [stop the dice while they are\r\nrolling] and shove them to the boxman.  He has\r\nto say ?no roll? quickly so there won't be a\r\nbeef.\r\n\r\nsecond dealing, n.  The act of dealing a card\r\nother than the top card on a pack.\r\n\r\n1891 Hoffman Baccarat.  There is, however, an\r\nexpedient familiar to conjurers as ?changing a\r\ncard,? which, with a little modification, is\r\nextensively used by the cardsharping fraternity\r\nunder the name of ?second dealing.?  The result\r\nof the sleight is that the dealer, while apparently\r\ngiving the top card in the usual way, actually\r\ngives the second card instead of it.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Clark relies to some extent on oral collections, his own\r\nand that of Thomas A. Martinet, which have been\r\nbuilt up over the years.  One is tempted to envision\r\nClark, ?wired,? hanging about in gambling dens; but\r\nanyone familiar with the casinos around the world\r\nknows that those glittery palaces could scarcely be so\r\ncharacterized.  Damon Runyon's ghost (or the ghosts of\r\nsome of the personnel who ?worked? his novels) will\r\nnot be in evidence here.\r\n\r\n            According to the Dictionary, a chute is the name\r\nfor the slot (over the drop box ) through which the\r\ndealer pushes the money paid for chips at a gaming\r\ntable.  According to Monte Carlo folklore, it was a\r\nslide, accessible only through a trap-door, that emptied\r\nout into the Mediterranean far below: the bodies\r\nof gamblers who had taken their own lives after losing\r\nthe family fortunes were dispatched through the chute\r\ninto oblivion.  What happens to bodies in Atlantic City,\r\nLas Vegas, and other gambling hells is not revealed in\r\nthis book, but one can be sure that those who run the\r\nestablishments do not take kindly to losers who ask for\r\ntheir money back, explaining that they did not know\r\nthat they were playing ?for keeps.?\r\n\r\n            There have been other dictionaries on the subject:\r\nClark lists the important ones as Sources at the end of\r\nthis volume.  But this work is probably the best of them\r\nall.  The Dictionary of Gambling & Gaming is not a\r\ngamble, and anyone putting down his $48 will be betting\r\non a sure thing.\r\n\r\n            Laurence Urdang\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Bloomsbury Good Word Guide\r\n\r\n            Some very talented people have brought their\r\nknowledge to bear on everyday questions and\r\nproblems of language in this book: Martin Manser,\r\nwhose Penguin Wordmaster Dictionary was favorably\r\nreviewed here [XIV, 2]; Betty Kirkpatrick, editor of\r\nChambers Twentieth Century Dictionary ; Jonathon\r\nGreen, compiler of the Thesaurus of Slang, Newspeak ,\r\nand a Dictionary of Jargon (soon to be reviewed here);\r\nand John Silverlight, who writes a language column in\r\nThe Observer , which I have not seen.  From such a\r\nformidable team, one should expect a good Good\r\nWord Guide .\r\n\r\n            This book suffers from the essential problem\r\nshared with all other books of reference: however\r\nsound the advice they give, it is useless and meaningless\r\nif it is not looked up.  That might seem too much of\r\na truism even for me to express, but let me explain.\r\nMany people feel that educational systems everywhere\r\nhave deteriorated to an unconscionably low level and\r\nthat students are no longer taught (in particular) English\r\ngrammar and usage the way they once were.  In\r\nthe ?good old days,? when the system was presumably\r\nbetter, many books on usage were also published, so\r\none must conclude that although students then might\r\nhave been ?exposed? to grammar and usage, they did\r\nnot learn it.  Yet, one does have the (possibly romantic)\r\nimpression that even though grammar and usage were\r\nnot properly learned, at least enough of a subliminal\r\nimpression of them was retained by students to lead\r\nthem to doubt a construction when they encountered\r\nit, driving them to check it in a Fowler or some other\r\nwork.  What I am getting at is that more and more\r\npeople today seem to be less and less aware of any but\r\ntheir own way of using the language, either because\r\nthey are no longer exposed to the writings of great\r\nauthors, or because they are not taught grammar and\r\nusage and style, or both.  The only way students can be\r\ntaught to improve their use of any language is by compelling\r\nthem to use it, chiefly by requiring of them on\r\na regular basis, preferably not less often than once a\r\nweek, a piece of writing which is gone over carefully\r\nfor usage and grammar to ensure a compatibility with\r\na standard to be devoutly wished for if not achieved.\r\nAfter five years or more of such exercise, even if the\r\nindividual cannot recall the difference between imply\r\nand infer , at least it is likely that whenever a choice is\r\nencountered a small bell will ring somewhere in the\r\nrecesses of his mind, recalling a long-forgotten paper\r\nfor which the grade might have been reduced because\r\nof a failure to know the difference.  If this were a Rube\r\nGoldberg contraption, this recollection would remind\r\nthe writer of the grease spot on page 2, caused by his\r\nhaving eaten a Big Mac, the memory of which conjures\r\nup such a vivid image that the writer opens his\r\nmouth to take a bite, and a string attached to his lower\r\njaw releases a mouse, the sight of which arouses a cat\r\nwhich chases it, causing the mouse to squeal, awakening\r\na midget who stretches, tripping open a trapdoor;\r\nthrough the trapdoor falls a usage book, sliding down\r\na chute into the hands of the writer.\r\n\r\n            Would that life were so simple!\r\n\r\n            There appears to be nothing remaining to prompt\r\npeople to use usage books--indeed, reference books of\r\nany kind.  In a time when professional writers write\r\nthings like, ?Neither Lord King nor Sir Colin Marshall\r\n... were available for comment...? (and worse),\r\none cannot accuse them of having made an error of\r\njudgment because that implies an awareness of choice;\r\nin order to have a choice, one must know of alternatives,\r\nand I am ineluctably drawn to the conclusion\r\nthat people write the way they do because they know\r\nof no alternative.\r\n\r\n            Those who publish usage books seem to believe\r\nthat sometime, somewhere, there will be people who,\r\nwhen they use neither , will immediately rush to their\r\nGood Word Guide to find out whether it takes a singular\r\nor a plural verb.  That, as we all know, is a forlorn\r\nhope (to abuse a Dutch clich?): those who ?know? that\r\nwhen two or more people or things are the subject of a\r\nverb you have to use were , not was , regardless of the\r\ncontext, are like those who ?know? (like the people at\r\nElizabeth Arden) that millennium is spelled with one\r\nn, who ?know? that it is Parmagiana , not Parmigiana\r\n(like the people at Burger King), and who have no\r\ndoubt that baking soda, baking powder, washing soda,\r\nand ice-cream soda are all the same thing.  The cause\r\nwould appear to be lost when one takes note that the\r\nonly pronunciation recorded in British dictionaries for\r\nmachismo is ?makizmo,? as if it were derived from\r\nItalian: even a spelling pronunciation would have been\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\n            Given the nature of the publishing business today,\r\nit is probably not at all surprising to see another usage\r\nbook (bearing in mind that the Fowler is being updated\r\nby Robert Burchfield), though, if you believe all\r\nthe foregoing palaver, no one will ever refer to it.  All\r\nthat having been said, it must be acknowledged that as\r\nlong as people buy books, publishers do not really\r\nmuch care whether they are read, used as doorstops,\r\nor for propping up a sagging curio cabinet.\r\n\r\n            Turning to the Introduction, written by Betty\r\nKirkpatrick, we read, ?There is a school of thought\r\nprevalent mainly among older people which seeks to\r\nimpose a kind of restriction on language that is not\r\nimposed on other areas of life.?  [p. v] I guess that\r\n?older? means `anyone older than Kirkpatrick,' which I\r\nhappen to be; but, while it is a matter of fact (and of\r\nrecord) that I do seek to impose restrictions, they are\r\ndirected against inept, ineffectual, inaccurate language\r\nand poor style.  Moreover, who says I don't seek\r\nto impose restrictions on other areas of life?  I despise\r\nbad art, hypocrisy and other forms of dishonesty and,\r\nin general, execrate any policy or behavior that interferes\r\nwith the rights and freedoms of others.\r\n\r\n            Having relegated conservatism and old fogeyism\r\nto one another, Kirkpatrick asks [p. vi], ?Should we say\r\nit wasn't I or it wasn't me ; between you and me or\r\nbetween you and I; different from, different to , or\r\ndifferent than; less bottles of milk or fewer bottles of\r\nmilk ??  (In my own recommended usage, when it\r\ncomes to milk, it makes no difference; but if you are\r\ntalking about beer or gin, then neither is acceptable.)\r\nWhat does that word should mean?  Smacks of old\r\nfogeyism, does it not?\r\n\r\n            Further down page vi: ?Where a supposed alternatives\r\nis in fact wrong this is clearly stated.?  Wrong ?\r\nWho is the old fogey now, Kirkpatrick?  Again and\r\nagain we read about ?the careful user, who wishes to\r\nuse English correctly and congently? in contrast to ?the\r\nrun-of-the-mill user, who frequently sacrifices care and\r\ncorrectness in the interests of speed.?  To impute such\r\nsacrifices to a desire for speed is not only a misinterpretation\r\nof the evidence but a curious thing to say, for\r\nthose who are in a hurry are scarcely likely to stop\r\neverything, pick up this (or any other book) to check\r\nsomething, and then resume their headlong plunge\r\ninto the solecistic abyss.  Are not the ?run-of-the-mill\r\nusers? really just ?the careless users, who [as they\r\nwould probably say] could care less about using English\r\ncorrectly and cogently??\r\n\r\n            The most attractive thing about this book is the\r\nwriting, which, for the most part, is simple, clear,\r\nstraightforward, and readable.  In short, the book is\r\n?user-friendly.?  It is essentially a British work for the\r\nBritish market (or for people who want to use English\r\nthe way the British do).  The entries cover spelling,\r\npronunciation, grammar, punctuation, usage, buzz\r\nwords, and subsets of all of those.  The advice is direct\r\n(if old-fogeyish):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative should not be used in place of alternate.\r\n[Deceptively] is frequently misused....\r\n\r\n[D]espite of is incorrect, and it is never necessary\r\nto precede either despite or in spite of with but.\r\nTo avoid mistakes, remember the a in aircraft and\r\nhangar.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            ...And so on.  In other words, one gets the impression\r\nthat the convervatism criticized on page v was\r\npromptly forgotton on page vi.  Inevitably, I have some\r\nsuggestions and criticisms to offer:\r\n\r\n            It would have been useful, when discussing the\r\nspelling of gynaecology , to have added a word on its\r\npronunciation.\r\n\r\n            A note on custom (Brit.) versus business (U.S.)\r\nmight prove helpful.\r\n\r\n            At the entry for bi -, the definition of bicentennial\r\nas `every two hundred years' omits mention of its more\r\ncommonly encountered use as a noun (along with bi-centenary )\r\nmeaning `two-hundredth anniversary.?\r\n\r\n            A note on annual would have been useful to criticize\r\nthe usage ?First Annual Competition.?\r\n\r\n            There are some typographical errors, as in the\r\nsecond pronunciation of dinghy , where the roman ?i?\r\nshould have been in italics.  The bad hyphenations,\r\napparently performed by a (feeble-minded, misprogrammed)\r\ncomputer and not reviewed by a\r\n(knowledgeable) proofreader, are inexcusable in a\r\nbook of this kind: ?buc-ket? (at - ful ); prop-osed (at\r\nirony ); ?sing-ular? ( at kind of ); ?trad-itionally? (at or);\r\n?ostentati-ous? (at ostensible ), etc.  The worst and most\r\nembarrassing--if these sorts of things can still embarrass\r\npublishers -- is ?spel-ling,? which occurs at Americanism\r\nand again at your or you're ?, from which it is\r\npicked up for reproduction on page xi of the front\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n            The writing falters in the entries for imply or infer ?\r\nand centre on or centre around ?\r\n\r\n            A funny thing or two happened in the pronunciation\r\nkey: the distinction is made between r as the symbol\r\nfor the initial sound in rim and rr for the medial\r\nsound in marry .  Although these are different sounds in\r\nmany British English dialects, they are not only allophonic\r\nbut in complementary distribution (that is,\r\nthey never exchange places), hence do not need separate\r\nsymbols.  Also, the editors have avoided the schwa\r\n\\?\\, preferring to resurrect the antediluvian system\r\nused by Merriam-Webster in the Second Edition of\r\ntheir Unabridged (and since abandoned by almost\r\neveryone).  Even in the ?ah-OO-gah,? or ?moo-goo-gaipan?\r\nschool of pronunciation, the unstressed vowel is\r\nrendered by a uniform symbol, usually ?uh.?\r\n\r\n            At and/or we read, ? cotton and/or nylon socks , for\r\nexample, means `cotton socks, nylon socks, and socks\r\nmade from a mixture of cotton and nylon.' ? To me, it\r\nmeans, `cotton socks, or nylon socks, or both': there is\r\nnothing inherent in the example even hinting at the\r\nexistence of socks made of a nylon and cotton mixture.\r\n\r\n            In the matter of Celsius versus centigrade , the\r\npoint is not that they are ?identical? (which is ambiguous\r\nfor `very similar' and `the same thing'), but that\r\nthey are the same thing: the scale formerly called centigrade\r\nwas renamed in 1948 to honor Anders Celsius,\r\nthe 18th-century Swedish astronomer who devised it.\r\n\r\n            Information on American usage is treated inconsistently\r\nand, as the book is for the British user, might\r\nwell have been eliminated altogether.\r\n\r\n            There is no entry for free gift , just as obnoxious in\r\nBritain as anywhere else English is used.\r\n\r\n            An entry on this or that ?  would have been in order,\r\nchiefly to cover its usage as a pronoun or pronominal\r\nadjective of reference.\r\n\r\n            In the entry for former or latter ?  the advice is\r\ngiven to write, ? The killer left...in a stolen car; this\r\n[not the latter ] was later found... .?  I do not consider\r\nthat good writing.\r\n\r\n            As for the English word forte `strength,' it is not\r\nthe feminine form of the French adjective fort `strong'\r\nbut an English ?feminization? of the French noun fort\r\n`strength.'  The pronunciation ?for-tay? is an illiteracy,\r\nscarcely attributable (as given here and in various dictionaries)\r\nto a confusion with the musical direction so\r\npronounced because that is a loanword from Italian:\r\nthose who know about musical directions are not likely\r\nto blunder that badly.\r\n\r\n            If enough people buy this book, it will soon need\r\na second printing which, it is hoped, will include some\r\nof the foregoing (not these ) recommendations.\r\n\r\n            Laurence Urdang\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n?Free lays to the first 50 people!!?  [From an invitation to\r\na ?Blue Hawaii? Beach Party in Staff Bulletin No. 31, p. 6, of\r\nthe Madison Area (Wisconsin) Tech College.  Submitted by\r\n.]\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n               Scrubs Wormwood for Gall\r\n            \r\n\r\n            According to the EFL Gazette [June 1988], a\r\njudge in Birmingham, England, was outraged that a\r\nPakistani, resident in Britain for 23 years, had the\r\neffrontery to be so ignorant of English as to need an\r\ninterpreter in court; he sentenced the culprit to two\r\nyears' probation with the condition that he learn the\r\nlanguage.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            One of the worst decAIDS in memory, the theme song\r\nof the '80s ought to be\r\n\r\n            Every little breeze\r\n\r\n            Seems to whisper ?lues.?\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Bardoubling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            When Imogen rhapsodizes on the immensity of\r\nher love for her banished husband she insists it is beyond\r\nbeyond .  For many years I have been captivated\r\nby that phrase, created by the doubling of a fairly\r\nordinary preposition/noun, now magically employed\r\nin just that relationship.  This expression of infinity\r\nproduces a stunning effect, one not likely with two or\r\nthree discrete words.  Shakespeare has coined an expansive\r\nimage out of the minimum arrangement of\r\nthis simple word.  And beyond beyond describes the\r\npoet himself, in his surpassing power of imagination\r\nand his unparalleled gift for language.\r\n\r\n            Thus inspired, I dreamed up a new word game.\r\nFor the moment, call it ?Doubling.?  The player who\r\nhas devised a `double' provides to the others a definition,\r\nwhereupon they try to respond with the precise\r\ndouble.  Example: what has the cobbler when only one\r\nshoe form remains?  Obvious answer, his last last .  Or,\r\nlast exam?  Why, final final , of course.  A verb/noun\r\nentry: to tough out a storm, that is, to weather\r\nweather .  More doubles, minus definitions, are: cozy\r\ncozy, March march, short short, fair fair , and so on.\r\n\r\n            Our rules for playing are: capitalized words or\r\nproper names are allowed, but redundant entries are\r\nnot; slick slick does not qualify.  Nor do hyphenated\r\nphrases, such as go-go, no-no , which are merely intensification.\r\nThe two words must be identical in spelling,\r\nbut not in capitalization.  However, players might well\r\nmake their own rules.\r\n\r\n            This game was invented as `More matter for a May\r\nmorning' when my wife and I drove last month from\r\nWest Texas to Hamilton, Montana, a goodly distance,\r\nbe assured.  The scenery was not always breathtaking,\r\nso a new word game (verbal, no paraphernalia) was\r\nneeded to keep us awake.  To honor the source of its\r\ninspiration, should we perhaps entitle it ?Bardling,? or\r\nhow about ?Bardoubling??  Robert D. Anson\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            According to The Times [19 May 1988], Maria\r\nTandy immigrated to Britain from Gyomaendrod,\r\nHungary, in 1938 to work as a servant.  Within a short\r\ntime, her employer had been sent to India, costing her\r\nthe position, and she learned of the death of her\r\nmother.  The shock was severe enough to strike her\r\ndumb, and she was committed to a London hospital.\r\nWhen she recovered her power of speech, her English\r\nwas so bad that she could not make herself understood,\r\nand she languished in the hospital for almost 40\r\nyears--till recently, when the hospital began to make\r\narrangements to close and move her elsewhere.  An\r\ninterpreter was called in, investigated her background\r\nand story, and discovered that some of her sisters still\r\nlived in Hungary.  Miss Tandy, now 78, will rejoin her\r\nfamily to live out her years.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            To Mr. Sebastian's most enjoyable article, ?Red\r\nPants? [XV,3] may I presume to add ?The Lay of the\r\nLast Minstrel??\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            The definition of schmeer [XV, 3] in Webster's\r\nThird New International Dictionary is wrong--or at\r\nleast incomplete.  Schmeer is a Yiddish verb meaning\r\n`to apply an ointment or lubricant' and is commonly\r\nused as a slang term for `bribe,' no doubt because a\r\nbribe is seen as lubricating the wheels of bureaucracy.\r\nI cannot imagine how it has come to mean the `entire\r\ndeal, whole package.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            Certainly VERBATIM is one of the most literate\r\npublications in the English-speaking world today.  Because\r\nof that, I was surprised (and a little shocked) to\r\nfind the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin referred to as\r\n?Miss? Stowe in Robert M. Sebastian's amusing article,\r\n?Red Pants.?  Surely every student of American literature\r\nknows that Harriet Beecher Stowe was the sister of\r\nthe famous clergyman Henry Ward Beecher and the\r\nwife of Dr. Calvin Stowe, another eminent divine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            [ Similarly from Col. Robert O. Rupp, Colorado\r\nSprings.]\r\n            \r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            I am surprised that to my knowledge, there has\r\nbeen no published response to ETYMOLOGICA OBSCURA\r\n[XIV,4] with regard to the weasel .  Surely there is\r\nsomeone else alive besides myself who was taught the\r\ndance as a child and was told that the weasel was part\r\nof a stitching and weaving machine.  During part of\r\nthe dance, partners did weave in and out.  In another\r\npart, the two head dancers skipped down the inside of\r\na double row and back outside, exchanging places\r\nwith the next in line, thus ?popping the weasel.?\r\n\r\n            The following words would seem to indicate that\r\nthe weasel was a part of a sewing machine:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA penny for a spool of thread,\r\n\r\nA penny for a needle.\r\n\r\nThat's the way the money goes--\r\n\r\n?Pop!? goes the weasel.\r\n\r\nUp and down the village street,\r\n\r\nUp and down the teasle... etc.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The teasle is also part of a stitching machine.  I don't\r\nrecall the ?monkey? part of the verse, but this could be\r\nthe mechanism which ?popped? the weasel by checking\r\nthe stitching and reversing the machine to start a\r\nnew row.  Frequently, the thread broke at this time and\r\nthe machine had to be rethreaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Favorite Grammatical Games: Legerdemain in Two Senses and False Scents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            In front of a cozy fire on a winter's night in the\r\nlibrary of one of John Cheever's country houses, on\r\nthe beach at Waikiki, even on a New York or London\r\ncommuter train, finding Legerdemain in Two Senses\r\nand False Scents can be fun and games for all, and all\r\nyou need is (usually) some printed matter or even just\r\nan inventive mind.\r\n\r\n            In Fowler's Modern English Usage one of the more\r\nintriguing entries is Legerdemain in Two Senses .\r\nUnder that heading he points out the sneaky way in\r\nwhich one word is often two-faced in the sense that its\r\nfirst meaning gets switched when it is used the second\r\ntime in a sentence.  For example, here is one that I have\r\nslightly titivated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMark had now got his first taste of women, and it\r\nwas a taste that was to show many developments.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Fowler points out that the taste Mark got first was an\r\n`experience'; the taste that showed developments was\r\nan `inclination.'  (It was a first taste of print that Mark\r\ngets in Fowler, if you are wondering about that titivation.)\r\nThe technical name for the device is polyptoton .\r\n\r\n            In other words, what happens is something like\r\nthe legerdemain of a magician's now-you-see-it-now-you-don't.\r\nDid you catch my alls in the first paragraph,\r\nby the way?  Let's look as a few other choice\r\nspecimens I have bagged:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is dangerous to mess around with Ouija boards\r\n... and it is dangerous to condone them.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The first dangerous means `harmful,' while the second\r\nmeans `irresponsible.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPretty girls finish first, which is pretty unfair to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe pretty pousse caf? is pretty hard to pour.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            In the last two examples an adjective switches to an\r\nadverb.  An ultimate epitome of the case: ?She's pretty\r\npretty.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSixty-five is just as safe as fifty-five, so it's safe to\r\nallow the faster speed.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Or to give equal time, as it were:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55 is safer than 65 mph, so it is safer to keep the\r\nlimit at 55.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            There is a nice touch of political legerdemain here,\r\nyou'll note, when the first safe(r) changes before our\r\nvery eyes from having a physical connotation to a\r\nsocio-political one.\r\n\r\n            There is a lovely example in Fowler about government ,\r\nwhich shows how slack political phraseology\r\ncan turn out to be (we just dropped a False Scent --no\r\ncomma between the qualifiers of phraseology -- see below)\r\na black beast in any era; obviously the beast was\r\nrampaging even in Fowler's golden days.  We'll bring\r\nthings up to date by presenting his example in modern\r\ndress:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany third-world countries are virtually subject to\r\nour American democratic government, but such\r\ngovernment has generally been held back by Congress\r\nfrom taking any decisive action.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Sounds fair enough, surely?  Ah, but you see there is a\r\nsubtle quick-change there, and, these days, we should\r\nwonder whether it was intentional or just imprecise\r\ngrammar.  The first government really means `governance'\r\nwhile the second means `governing body.'  True,\r\nthere is an acceptable synonymity here but it is not to\r\nbe used in the same sentence.\r\nAnd how about:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must indeed all hang together, or... we shall\r\nall hang separately.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Such sloppiness can indeed become rich fare for the\r\nSupreme Court.\r\n\r\n            Now we come to those delightful False Scents .\r\n\r\n            They are sly.  By all means read Fowler's delightful\r\nstatement of affairs about False Scents --he generates a\r\nwonderfully, though quite unwitting, humorous cameo\r\nof writer and reader virtually calling each other fools.\r\nThe reader wins because he is right--it is up to the\r\nwriter to ensure that the reader should not be given\r\nany False Scents .  Here are two additional ones to the\r\nfour examples Fowler gives that cause a reader to go\r\ndown the wrong track in a sentence, ending in a sort of\r\ndouble-take:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur found, after taking a wrong turning and\r\ngoing right past the house, and having looked for it\r\ncarefully the day before, that he had left his pen\r\nand briefcase at home.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            And we all thought he was going to find his dream\r\nhouse--or perhaps a million-dollar baby in a five-and-ten-cent\r\nstore.  Or as Fowler would (perhaps) say,\r\nArthur found a noun clause instead of a good solid\r\ncommon noun he could mortgage or marry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaning forward, with her hand shielding the\r\nstrong sunlight from her eyes, she was looking,\r\nArthur thought, particularly beautiful and poised.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            We are beginning to get angry with Arthur.  We all\r\nthought she was looking for him at least; certainly not\r\nfor a mere predicate adjective.\r\n\r\n            Watch for more Favorite Grammatical Games in\r\nfollowing issues of VERBATIM.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Brahman or brahman?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            For several generations the Sanskrit word brahman\r\n(pronounced BRAAHMAN, the first vowel sounds as\r\nin the English word father ) has been used in the English\r\nlanguage.  Until a decade or so ago it was spelt\r\nbrahmin , which is now given as an alternate spelling,\r\nand has survived in such expressions of common occurrence\r\nas Boston Brahmins .  While every literate American\r\nmay not be familiar with the expression, those\r\nwho are will know that a Boston Brahmin refers to the\r\naristocrats or first families of Boston such as the Cabots\r\nand the Lodges.  My concern is not with the meaning\r\nof the expression but with the persistent capitalization\r\nof the word.\r\n\r\n            Derived from Brahma `the First Principle or Supreme\r\nBeing of some Hindu philosophical systems\r\nsuch as Vedanta,' a brahman is primarily a person who\r\nbelieves in Brahma , or Brahman .  By extension brahman\r\ncame to mean a `member of the sacred or sacerdotal\r\ncaste,' as Webster has it.  In order to avoid confusion\r\nI shall henceforth spell the word without capitalization\r\nto denote the `caste' and with a capital to\r\nimply `the Absolute.'  This in fact is the crux of the\r\nproblem.  When we use the word Absolute with a capital\r\n?a? we know that it has a very specific application.\r\nIt is high time that brahman be so spelt when the caste\r\nis implied, reserving Brahman when `the Absolute' is\r\nmeant.  This will not only help the reader to distinguish\r\nbetween the two meanings but will conform to\r\nconventional capitalization in the English language.\r\n\r\n            The error was originally made by the British in\r\n17th-century India.  Not only were the brahmans the\r\nbest educated Hindus they met, but also, more important,\r\nit was soon realized that among the Hindus the\r\nbrahman was a much more ?sacred? group than say\r\nthe molla is among the Muslims, the rabbi among the\r\nJews, or the priest among the Christians.  From time\r\nimmemorial the brahmans of India had insisted upon\r\ntheir social and spiritual superiority.  In many of the\r\ncommon Sanskrit prayers a brahman is invoked or imprecated\r\nalong with the gods.  To do reverence to a\r\nbrahman was to do reverence to Brahman, for a brahman\r\nwas not simply the intermediary between man\r\nand the gods: he was a god.\r\n\r\n            Confronted with this attitude and somewhat\r\nawed, the British acknowledged their respect by capitalizing\r\nthe word.  But what is even more curious is\r\nthat they also capitalized the expressions for the three\r\nother castes, viz. kshatriya `martial class,' vaisya `farmers\r\nand merchants,' and sudra `menials.'  It is remarkable\r\nthat this anomaly still persists, even in many modern\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n            The English-speaking world, expecially Great\r\nBritain, Canada, the U.S.A., and even India claim to\r\nbe the bastions of democracy, which clearly should not\r\nrecognize caste or class distinctions.  Is it not ironic\r\nthen that they should still perpetuate so blatant a fallacy?\r\nCompilers of our dictionaries should stop capitalizing\r\nthe words for the four Hindu castes and retain\r\nthe custom only for Brahma or Brahman when it implies\r\nthe Absolute.  Not only will it avoid confusion\r\namong users of dictionaries, but it will restore the\r\npreeminence of Brahma or Brahman while reducing\r\nthe brahmans to the status of the rest of us mortals,\r\nwhere they really belong.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            \r\n               Harare (Reuter) - A Latin greeting from the Pope\r\nbrought Zimbabwe's Parliament to a halt when the\r\nJustice Minister, Mr Emmerson Mnangagwa, objected\r\nto the use of what was not an official language.  [ The\r\nTimes , 30 September 1988]\r\n\r\n            On January 12th, 1989, Carole Leonard, who compiles\r\na chatty column for The Times of items picked up\r\non the Rialto in The City, reported that a ?reader in\r\nSurrey? (not, for a change, ?Disgusted,? Tunbridge\r\nWells) received a tax form with the instruction ?Send\r\nthe cheque and payslip unfolded to the Collector in the\r\nenvelope provided.?  ?I looked inside,? wrote the mystified\r\nreader, ?but couldn't find him.?  A few pages on,\r\nthe Scots Law Report carried the headline, ?Causing\r\ndeath by reckless driving of person unborn at time of\r\naccident.?\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            Maxey Brooke's article, ?Texican? [XV,2], was an\r\ninteresting comment on a phenomenon that must fascinate\r\nanybody who loves words.  Who would have\r\nthought that a word like quirt , which I had always\r\nassociated with hounds and stirrup cups, came from\r\nthe Spanish for `rope,' or `string,' cuerda .  The meagre\r\nsources I have at home bear out that origin, however.\r\n\r\n            I hope Mr. Brooke will forgive my picking a couple\r\nof nits.  He implies that chile and tamale are Mexican\r\nwords that have passed into English usage.  They\r\nmay be Texican in that form, but in the original Mexican\r\nthey had to be chile and tamal ( chilis and tamales\r\nin the plural, of course.)  Chile is the country, and even\r\nthe most ignorant Mexican would not call one tamal a\r\ntamale .\r\n\r\n            The word transfers work in the opposite direction,\r\ntoo, of course.  Witness the Mexican and Central American\r\nuse of parquear `to park,' instead of the more\r\ntraditionally Spanish estacionar .  A dancing in Buenos\r\nAires is a rather low-class nightclub.  For wrestling, or\r\nwhat is loosely called wrestling in the United States\r\nand Latin America, the people of the Southern Cone\r\nof South America went to the English catch-as-catchcan .\r\nIf you are familiar with the difficulty Spanish\r\nspeakers have with dentals and fricatives when these\r\nare not separated by vowels, you can understand that\r\nthe task of producing a string of sounds like that tends\r\nto stop a conversation, if not the speaker.  So it was soon\r\nshortened to catchascan , and then ultimately to catch ,\r\nleaving the t in the written form, although it is foreign\r\nto Spanish orthography.  So in Buenos Aires, if you\r\nwant to inform somebody you are going to the wrestling\r\nmatches, you say ? Voy al catch .?\r\n\r\n            I guess people are a little nutty if they take a\r\ndelight in these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            David W. Porter [XV,3] tells us that the Japanese\r\n?produce such monstrosities as sutoraike for English\r\n`strike'...? Sad to say, he is doubly wrong.  In baseball,\r\nthe transliteration is equivalent to sutoraiku ; in\r\nlabor relations (an earlier borrowing) to sutoraiki .\r\n\r\n            As for Gone with the Windo , he errs in leaving\r\nGone with the untouched and his Windo would correctly\r\nbe Uindo .  Others of his assertions are not amenable\r\nto brief correction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            Mr. J.A. Davidson should not adopt the pronunciation\r\nof scone to rhyme with `bone'--at any rate not\r\nbecause Victoria, where he lives, is ?veddy English.?\r\nThat pronunciation is a shibboleth, or rather sibboleth,\r\nin English English in terms of ?U? and ?non-U?--as\r\nJohn Betjeman noted years ago in his cautionary\r\npoem How to Get On in Society , which ends:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk and then just as it comes, dear?\r\n\r\nI'm afraid the preserve's full of stones;\r\n\r\nBeg Pardon, I'm spoiling the doileys\r\nWith afternoon tea-cakes and scones.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            (The first line of the poem, in case anyone wants to\r\nread more of it, is ?Phone for the fish-knives, Norman.?)\r\n\r\n            Mr. Davidson misquotes Gowers, who does not say\r\nthat the Scottish pronunciation is `skawn' (which\r\nwould rhyme with `dawn.')  What he gives is\r\n`sk\\?\\n'--with a `short sign' over the o --rhyming with\r\n`don,' which is socially correct south of the Border as\r\nwell as north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            A friend showed me VERBATIM [XIV,3] in which I\r\nnoted the paragraph on page 2 about names for subatomic\r\nparticles.  Actually, the word quark is in the\r\nOED as a verb meaning `croak,' with 19th-century references\r\nto frogs, rooks, and herons.  This seems more\r\nrelevant to Joyce's use than the German word for\r\n`curds.'  This was missed by Tindall in his Reader's\r\nGuide to Finnegans Wake and McHugh in his Annotations\r\nto FW , while Glasheen has it in her 3rd Census .\r\n\r\n            Much could be said about particle names.  SUSY\r\n(pronounced as spelt), or supersymmetry theory, is\r\nprolific.  Each known elementary particle is associated\r\nwith a hypothetical complementary particle (recalling,\r\nsurely unintentionally, ?sosie sesthers,? ( FW , p.3):\r\nSUSY = ?  French sosie = `twin').  Most Joycean are\r\nslepton (partner to the leptons) and wino (partner to\r\nthe W boson) ... as well as squark .  There's lots more\r\nin the field (or not in it), such as techniquarks,\r\nglueballs , and ghosts (which are not really there).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            Further to ?Do Mistake--Learn Better? [XV,1]:\r\nDuring the Vietnamese conflict, the country was filled\r\nwith mangled English-Vietnamese-English translations,\r\nespecially in correspondence between assorted\r\noffices of the two nations.  The overwhelming majority\r\nof the confusion stemmed from the fact that the only\r\n?complete? bilingual dictionary readily available to\r\nthe Vietnamese was a two-volume monstrosity by a\r\nFrench professor in the 1920s.  I cannot answer for his\r\ncommand of Vietnamese; his grasp of English was, to\r\nput it mildly, feeble and slippery.\r\n\r\n            The Central Intelligence Agency was widely\r\nknown as the ?Inside Detective Bureau?; we eventually\r\nstarted to use it ourselves.  A phrase commonly used by\r\nVietnamese commands to describe what they were doing\r\nto North Vietnam was ?foil up their dark schemes.?\r\n\r\n            I had a Mrs. Ban assigned to me as a translator;\r\nshe spoke exquisite French and fluent--if somewhat\r\nstilted--English.  On one occasion I asked her to translate\r\na document into Vietnamese describing the modus\r\noperandi of the Soviet Illegals program.  It was then\r\npassed to a Vietnamese office, which a week later returned\r\nit, politely reporting that they couldn't make\r\nhead or tail of it.  I took a paragraph at random and\r\npassed it to another translator, asking him to render it\r\ninto English, and the problem became immediately\r\napparent.\r\n\r\n            The original contained the sentence, ?The Soviet\r\nIllegal, blending with the populace, is free of the unwelcome\r\nlimelight cast on the personnel of the Soviet\r\nembassy by the local security forces.?  What came back\r\nwas, ?The police threw a burning citrus tree at the\r\nSlavic bandit, who was disguised as a crowd; they\r\nmissed him but hit the Russian ambassador.?\r\n\r\n            I called for Mrs. Ban and told her I would read\r\nthe document to her, paragraph by paragraph.  She\r\nwas to ask any questions she wanted to, and when she\r\nunderstood the passage, she was to render it freely into\r\nVietnamese, without attempting to make a verbatim\r\ntranslation.  It worked beautifully.\r\n\r\n            In the course of the first session with Mrs. Ban,\r\nthe word cipher came up; she did not understand it.  I\r\nstarted to explain, and then noticed a copy of The\r\nSaturday Review on my desk.  ?Here,? I said, turning\r\nto the Literary Cryptogram.  ?This is a cipher.  It's a\r\nshort quotation from some well-known author, with\r\nhis name.  For every letter, another one has been substituted,\r\nso you can't read it.  You have to puzzle it out.?\r\n\r\n            She picked up the magazine, inspected the cryptogram,\r\nfrowned, nodded, and left the office.  She was\r\nback within fifteen minutes with the correct solution\r\ninked in over the mono-alphabetical cipher.  I was\r\nstunned.\r\n\r\n            ?Mrs. Ban,? I said, ?Very few Americans could\r\nwork that out without being taught how to go about\r\nit.  Would you mind explaining how you did it??\r\n\r\n            ?Sure.  You say name is well-known author.  Name\r\nis XQ PLRZADLTRQTXF.  I look at first name, two letters.\r\nOnly American first names with two letters are Ed and\r\nAl , and you got no famous writers in America or England\r\nnamed Ed or Al .  So I think maybe particule --?De?\r\nor ?La?--hey!  Maybe ?La Rochefoucauld\r\n!?  And, yes, ls, as, os , and us all come out in right\r\nplace.  So I write in up above, and rest is easy.  Fun!  You\r\ngot more??\r\n\r\n            I gave her a raise on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            In ?The Joys and Oys of Yiddish? [XV,3], Messrs.\r\nLederer and Schenkerman put the word cockamamy\r\n(or cockamamie ) at the head of a list of Yiddish words\r\nfound in English as published in Webster's Third New\r\nInternational Dictionary .  I have spoken Yiddish since\r\nchildhood, have a fairly wide reading knowledge and\r\nacquaintance with various levels and styles of the language,\r\nbut have never come across a word or phrase\r\nresembling cockamamy .  It simply has no meaning in\r\nthat language.  Leo Rosten may list it in his book, The\r\nJoys of Yiddish , but he fails to make a positive identification.\r\nAs for gun moll , there was no phrase in the\r\nWarsaw or Odessa underworlds like ?gonif molly.?  If I\r\nam not mistaken, the word moll is a well-rooted native\r\nword in English going back at least as far as Daniel\r\nDefoe's Moll Flanders .  The gun part derives plainly\r\nfrom the English gun .\r\n\r\n            As for schnoz , it does sound Yiddish, there does\r\nexist a verb schneitzen `to blow one's nose,' and the\r\nshn - combination does connote something to do with\r\nthe nose; but there is no word shnozzle in Yiddish, only\r\nnoz or, in the alternate dialect, nuz .  Phudnik is not a\r\nYiddish word but was clearly formed on the Yiddish\r\nroot -nik , which also occurs in Slavic.  I don't know\r\nwhere the -sh sound arose in nebbish , but in all eastern\r\nEuropean dialects of Yiddish the word is nebbikh or\r\nnebbakh , with a velar fricative sound that is rendered\r\nas -sh by speakers who find that easier to pronounce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            Concerning Thomas H. Middleton's ?Muskrats `R'\r\nNot??  [XV,3], according to the album cover of my LP,\r\nOry's Creole Trombone (Good Time Jazz, L12004),\r\nthe origin of the name of ?Muskrat Ramble? was at the\r\nsession at which the newly composed tune was first\r\nrecorded.  As the musicians were leaving, a record\r\ncompany representative asked the name of the new\r\npiece, which Kid Ory had not yet named.  Lil Armstrong,\r\nwho was the pianist for the session, improvised\r\nthe answer, ?That's named `Muskrat Ramble'; isn't\r\nthat right, Red??  (Red was Kid Ory's nickname.)  Ory\r\nreplied, ?That's right.?  I remember that Lil Armstrong\r\nwas quoted on the record sleeve as giving this explanation;\r\nalthough I still have the LP, the sleeve was destroyed\r\nsome years ago.  The blurb went on to explain\r\nthat at a subsequent time some record company executive\r\ndecided that ?Muskrat Ramble? was too inelegant\r\na title and changed its name on future pressing to\r\n?Muskat [or Muscat] Ramble.?  My LP, from the 1950s,\r\ngives the title as ?Muskrat Ramble.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            As always, it was a delight to read the new VERBATIM.\r\nIt is even more fun, though, to catch our omniscient\r\neditor in a small blooper.  The comment on square\r\nthe circle in the review of Loose Cannons & Red Herrings\r\n[XV,3] misses the point when it states, ?...there\r\nis no mathematical way of calculating the dimensions of\r\na square with the same area as that of a given circle.?\r\nThis classic geometrical problem requires that one start\r\nwith a given circle and construct a square of the same\r\narea, using the straight-edge and compass, the only\r\ntools permitted the geometer.\r\n\r\n            The mathematician, on the other hand, can calculate\r\nthe dimensions of such a square, to any desired\r\ndegree of accuracy, using simple algebra.  You can\r\nquibble, of course, that such an answer can never be\r\nperfect, but that has nothing to do with the problem\r\nof squaring the circle geometrically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            [ Similarly from Iraj Kalantari, Macomb, Illinois, and\r\nJames G. Wendel, Palo Alto .]\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            \r\n               Pace Webster's Third [XV,3], but including the\r\nword cockamamie in a Yiddish lexicon is questionable,\r\nas is the definition given.  As a youngster in The Bronx\r\nin the early 1930s, I would occasionally take my windfall\r\nof a few pennies to the local candy store and buy a\r\nstrip of cockamamies , `comic-style cartoons in brilliant\r\ncolors, each about an inch by an inch and a half,\r\ntransferable to forearm or forehead by wetting,' preferably\r\nwith saliva to make things agreeably messy.  As we\r\ngrew older we came to realize that cockamamie was\r\nmerely a child's distortion of decalcomania .  Later,\r\ncockamamie came to mean `cheap, sleazy, gaudy,\r\ntrashy, junky'--but never ?mixed-up, ridiculous.?  I'll\r\naccept the word as a Bronxism, but not as an exclusive\r\nproperty of the Yiddish language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n            Maxey Brooke writes [XV,2] that English tamale is\r\nfrom Spanish tamale .  There is, however, no such Spanish\r\nword.  Rather, two explanations may be offered for\r\nthis English word.  My explanation is that English-speakers\r\nborrowed Spanish plural tamales (whose singular\r\nis tamal ), from which they back-formed a new\r\nsingular, tamale (i.e., the division into morphemes in\r\nSpanish is tamal-es whereas English-speakers took it to\r\nbe tamale-s ).  English has both frijol and frijole , the\r\nlatter of which may be explained in the same way:\r\nEnglish-speakers borrowed Spanish plural frijoles\r\n(whose singular is frijol ), from which they back-formed\r\na new singular, frijole (again, the morpheme\r\ndivision in Spanish is frijol-es whereas certain English-speakers\r\ntook it to be frijole-s ).  English frijol , on the\r\nother hand, is derived straightforwardly from the\r\nSpanish singular.\r\n\r\n            A different explanation of tamale was offered in\r\nAmerican Speech 48, 3-4, 1973, p. 292: ?Just as the\r\nAmerican recalls that French words should be stressed\r\non the final syllable, he recalls, or thinks he recalls,\r\nthat all Spanish words should end with a vowel: sombrero ,\r\nse?orita , noche and so on.  These items are all in\r\nthe singular.  Thus, by analogy, many Americans make\r\ntamale , instead of the correct tamal , the singular of\r\ntamales ....  By the same analogy, equipal , the splint\r\nand leather patio chair so popular in Mexico, becomes\r\nequipale ....?\r\n\r\n            The second explanation is possible, though numerous\r\nSpanish words end in a consonant and I don't\r\nknow how the two explanations could be verified.  The\r\nleast one may say is that no English dictionary published\r\nthrough 1987 gives a fully correct etymology for\r\ntamale or frijol(e) .\r\n\r\n            An English noun which is definitely back-formed\r\nfrom a plural is blints (often misspelled ?blintz?).  Yiddish\r\nhas (singular) blintse / (plural) blintses , hence\r\nblints is an English innovation.  Interestingly, whereas\r\ntamale and frijole have acquired a nonetymological\r\nvowel, blints has lost an etymological vowel.  In general,\r\nback-formation of new singulars from plurals is a\r\nsign that the plural is textually more frequent than the\r\nsingular (indeed, the Oxford English Dictionary lists\r\nonly frijoles and no singular form whatsoever for\r\nEnglish).\r\n\r\n            After the new singulars emerged in English, new\r\nplurals were formed.  Although English tamales , frijoles ,\r\nand blintses , as now usually pronounced, appear\r\nto be derived from Spanish tamales , Spanish frijoles ,\r\nand Yiddish blintses , they are actually innovations,\r\nformed in English by the addition of English -s (in the\r\nfirst two cases) or -es (in the third) to the innovative\r\nEnglish singulars.  This is proven by the fact that the\r\nEnglish plurals are pronounced with [z] and not, as in\r\nthe case of the Spanish and Yiddish plurals, with [s].\r\nThat is, since Spanish or Yiddish [s] > English [z]\r\nwould be phonologically unlikely here, -s and -es in the\r\nEnglish plurals are the native English plural allomorphs\r\nrather than Spanish- or Yiddish-origin allomorphs.\r\nOnly among the few people who pronounce\r\nthe English plurals with [s] are these words derived\r\nfrom the plurals used in Spanish or Yiddish.  Generally,\r\nthese are people strongly influenced by one of these\r\ntwo languages.\r\n\r\n            Brooke's derivation of machete from Spanish macho\r\n`male' is a folk etymology: the two words are unconnected\r\nand the correct etymology may be found on\r\npp. 746-750 of vol. 3 of Joan Corominas and Jos? A.\r\nPascual's Diccionario critico etimol?gico castellano e\r\nhisp?nico (Madrid, Gredos, 1980).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n?German Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl Sings With Doubleday.?\r\n[From Publishers Weekly , .  Submitted\r\nby .]\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Mrs. Malaprop in Mexico\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Mrs. Malaprop is so English that I thought her\r\n?nice derangement of epitaphs? was a glory\r\npeculiar to our language.  But then I lived in Mexico\r\nand soon knew better.  The first Mexican malapropism\r\nI heard, or recognized as such, was spoken at Chole\r\nDur?n's refreshment booth in the plaza of Jocotepec,\r\nJalisco.  Do?a Faustina was bringing Chole up to the\r\nminute, and in the course of her gossip she mentioned\r\nthat her niece Socorro had been gr?vida but was now\r\naliviada .  Two young farmhands were also at the\r\nbooth, drinking in the prattle with their Pepsis.  When\r\nFaustina left, one of them asked the other, ?Have you\r\never been gr?vido ??\r\n\r\n            ?Just once, when I was ten.  But my mother\r\nbought me some pills and I got over it.?\r\n\r\n            Chole tried not to laugh, but she laughed.  When\r\nshe explained to us that gr?vida means `pregnant,' the\r\nfarmhands loved the joke, their Indian eyes bright\r\nwith amusement.  One of them explained that they\r\nthought gr?vido was a more educated form of grave ,\r\nwhich means `gravely ill.'  As for aliviada , it means\r\nbeing `alleviated or cured.'  When a child is born, it is\r\nas if the mother had recovered from a disease.\r\n\r\n            After that, with my ears attuned, I heard malapropisms\r\non all sides, and even recognized that I\r\ncommitted them myself.  For a while, I confused ejote\r\n`string bean,' elote `corn on the cob,' and olote `corncob'\r\n(I fired the water heater with dried corncobs).\r\nPoor Lola, who cooked and cleaned for me, had to\r\ndivine what I meant when I asked for corncobs as a\r\ndinner vegetable or remarked that we were almost out\r\nof string beans for the water heater.  I was also guilty of\r\nasking her to serve a pork chop in adobe rather than\r\nadobo .  The latter is a sauce related to the mole that\r\nMoctezuma served to Cort?s.  The former, of course, is\r\na mud of another color.\r\n\r\n            Even so, I never blundered as badly as the dowager\r\nstaying at the little Hotel La Quinta.  She was on a\r\ndiet that forbade dessert and coffee, so she left the\r\ndining room before the other guests.  When she\r\nreached the doorway she always turned, gave a stately\r\nnod, and said, ?Excusado.?  Obviously she thought she\r\nwas saying, ?Excuse me,? and no one could find the\r\ncourage to tell her that excusado was a euphemism for\r\nwhat we call, among other things, the john.\r\n\r\n            In the back yard next to mine, young Mateo\r\nsometimes raised his voice in malapropistic song.  On\r\none occasion, what I heard over the wall was his version\r\nof ?Siete Leguas,? a ballad about Pancho Villa\r\nthat begins:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven Leagues was the horse\r\nThat Villa liked best.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            But Mateo changed leguas to lenguas , which means\r\n`tongues,' literally, or `languages.'  Was this remarkable\r\nhorse a polyglot?  No wonder Villa esteemed it.  On\r\nanother, Mateo warbled ?Ojitos de capul?n,? a familiar\r\nmariachi song.  A capul?n is a small, shiny-black fruit,\r\nand the title means that the girl's ?little eyes?--the\r\ndiminutive of affection, with no hint that she was\r\nbeady-eyed--were dark and lustrous.  In Mateo's version,\r\ncapul?n became chapul?n , which means `grasshopper.'\r\nSo she was not beady-eyed, but bug-eyed.\r\n\r\n            Small children are often malapropists, especially\r\nwhen they have to memorize texts they cannot understand.\r\nMy sister, when small, asked our parents if we\r\nlived in America.  On being assured that we did, she\r\nasked why they told her in school that we live in Tizzavy.\r\nIt turned out that she was referring to ?My country,\r\n'tis of thee....?\r\n\r\n            Lola's daughter, Teresa, was almost as inventive,\r\nand again it was the Lord's Prayer.  In Spanish it begins,\r\n?Padre nuestro que est?s en los cielos, santificado\r\nsea tu nombre.?  Teresa changed cielos to celos and\r\nsantificado to santo pintado , so that in Biblical English\r\nit comes out something like, ?Our Father which art in\r\njealousies, painted saint be Thy name.?  The first reminds\r\nme of ?I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,?\r\nand the second is not as far-fetched as it seems.  Although\r\nsanto means `saint,' a santo as an object means\r\na religious figure carved of wood, covered with gesso,\r\ncarved in detail, and then painted.  Teresa might have\r\nbeen thinking of the patron saint of Jocotepec, El se?or\r\ndel monte `The Lord of the Mountain,' a nearly life-sized\r\nsanto of the crucified Christ that is believed to\r\nhave been found in the branches of a tree in the mountains\r\nsouth of the village.\r\n\r\n            Finally, Lola, too, was a malapropist.  I bought a\r\npacket of Burpee's zinnia seeds in a pharmacy in Guadalajara,\r\nand when the plants bloomed I asked her\r\nwhat they were called in Spanish.  ?Normalginas,? she\r\nsaid.  Next day, showing them off to my landlord, I was\r\ngently told that the correct word was ?damasquinas,?\r\nwith its exotic evocation of damask and Damascus.\r\nWhen I asked him what ?normalginas? meant, if anything,\r\nhe said that Normalgina was the trade name of\r\na Mexican analgesic much like Anacin.\r\n\r\n            I decided to try it the next time I felt gr?vido .\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n?Major Ronald Ferguson, father of the Duchess of York,\r\nhas told the staff at his polo club that his daughter would not\r\nenter a private London hospital where she will give birth\r\nuntil Thursday.?

It is a practice to be recommended for one or\r\nmore of several reasons: one can often be spared reading\r\nthrough a boring, badly conceived, or abominably\r\nwritten work; one can determine quite readily why the\r\nbook was written and what its argument, or point,\r\nmight be, then read the text to judge whether the\r\nauthor's purpose has been carried out.  Such front matter\r\n(as it is more commonly called in the U.S.), or\r\nprelims (so called in Britain), is usually written by the\r\nauthor (or one of them).  There is a Preface to this\r\nbook, written by the estimable Janet Whitcut, which I\r\nshall get to in a moment.  First, though, is an essay,\r\n?What's the Usage?,?  by the inestimable Joseph Epstein,\r\neditor of American Scholar , professor of something\r\nat Northwestern University, and self-styled\r\npseud.  I hadn't noticed who had written the essay till I\r\nencountered the following, barely three paragraphs\r\ninto the writing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is closer to the truth to say that woolly circumlocutions,\r\npsychobabblous phrasing and sentiments,\r\nand language used as if it were a game of horseshoes\r\n(in which one expects points for being close)\r\noffends me.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Well, they offends me too, especially when they\r\nappears in the lead essay of a book on style and usage\r\nand particularly when it are a book of this quality.  I\r\nsaw little point in continuing reading Epstein when I\r\nwas sure that matters could only improve by turning to\r\nGowers, Greenbaum, and Whitcut, all of whom could\r\nbe relied on to make subjects and predicates agree in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n            Putting outright, downright grammatical solecisms\r\naside, it would be pertinent to reiterate my own\r\nattitude toward usage: as a linguist, I regard usage\r\nclinically and would no more criticize a writer or a\r\nspeaker of any kind of English for ?mistakes? than a\r\ndoctor would criticize a patient for contracting appendicitis\r\nor the Malay waste-away; on the other hand, as\r\na writer (albeit a poor one), I attend to matters of style\r\n(which includes usage and grammar, of course), not\r\nonly in others' writing but my own.  As readers are\r\nquick to point out, my attention to such matters occasionally\r\nwanders, for which I offer no excuses.  Yet the\r\nsense of discovery in finding Epsteinisms is undiminished,\r\nthough any glee is mitigated by the feeling of\r\nembarrassment undoubtedly shared among David R.\r\nGodine, respected publisher, and Greenbaum and\r\nWhitcut, respected colleagues and friends.\r\n\r\n            The first edition of The Complete Plain Words , an\r\nedited amalgan of Plain Words (1948) and The ABC\r\nof Plain Words (1951), appeared in 1954; an edition\r\nrevised by Sir Bruce Fraser was published in 1973; the\r\npresent work, published by Her Majesty's Stationery\r\nOffice (stolidly called ?Her Britannic Majesty's Stationary\r\n[ sic ] Office? on the copyright page) in 1986 to\r\ncelebrate its bicentennial, is a revision of Fraser's edition.\r\nAs Whitcut carefully indicates in her Preface,\r\nchapters 3-14 and 18 are ?almost pure Gowers....  In\r\nthis third edition `we' generally represents Greenbaum\r\nand Whitcut....?  I spent some time ferreting about\r\nin the new material and am pleased to report (as I\r\nsuspected) a sane and sensible approach (in chapter 15)\r\nto such topics as ?The trend towards informality? (the\r\nlanguage, even in Britain, is loosening up), ?The objections\r\nto sexist language? (?Present usage is unstable.\r\n...[O]fficial writers [ought] to take evasive action.?),\r\n?The influence of science and technology? (?[ I ] nput\r\nhas become an overworked vogue word... [as has]\r\nuser-friendly ....?), ?The influences of other varieties\r\nof English? (in which one can find good examples\r\nof so-called Americanisms that were formerly British).\r\n\r\n            The authors pull no punches, characterizing one\r\ngovernment memorandum as ?spoilt by carelessness,\r\nclich?s and flaccidity,? another as ?rather stilted...\r\n[but] by no means outrageous,? a third as ?verbose or\r\nstilted,? and a fourth as ?containing wording and\r\npunctuation that is clumsy, ambiguous, and redundant.?\r\nFor each of five specimens selected for analysis\r\nand comment, Greenbaum and Whitcut offer not only\r\ncriticism but cogent suggestions for improvement.  The\r\nsixth and seventh selections, one expository, one narrative,\r\nmerit the authors' praise: ?good? and ?graceful?\r\nare used in the comments; other adjectives are clear\r\n(structure), manageable (sentence length), appropriate\r\n(vocabulary), delicate (shifts of language level),\r\nand vivid .\r\n\r\n            The final chapter, 17, consists of a checklist of\r\n?words and phrases to be used with care.?  The inevitable\r\nold chestnuts are here-- infer/imply , appraise/\r\napprise , etc.--but most of the 250 or so entries in these\r\n70-odd pages deal with matters of style, word selection,\r\nand the avoidance of pompous or meaningless\r\nclich?s.  For instance,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly Prefer so or therefore.\r\n\r\nAccording to You can replace `According to our\r\nrecords' by `Our records show'....\r\n\r\nCondition (noun) If you mean rule, says so.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            ...and so forth.  Some of the entries are longer than\r\nthese, but not many.  Missing is the horrid at this point\r\nin time , but that probably occurs more in speech than\r\nin writing.  For a short list, it is a good one.\r\n\r\n            Of course, there is not much point in having any\r\nlist unless people use it, which brings me to my main\r\ncriticism of speakers and writers of a ?certain? age (say,\r\nunder 40) and education level.  To put the matter differently,\r\nI could write an essay called ?The Perils of\r\nLiteracy? or ?A Little Literacy Is a Dangerous Thing.?\r\nMuch of the ineffectual use of language is traceable to\r\nthe fact that although many people want to improve\r\ntheir language, they are completely unfamiliar with\r\nthe help available to them.  How, for example, are\r\npeople to know whether to use infer or imply if they\r\nare totally unaware that any problem exists?  For generations,\r\npeople have pronounced the word KONtr\\?\\v\\?\\rsee;\r\nthen, some odd body came along saying k\\?\\nTROV\\?\\rsee,\r\nand the faith of many speakers was shaken.\r\nIf they had looked it up in a dictionary, which lists the\r\npronunciation(s) used by a majority of speakers, k\\?\\nTROV\\?\\rsee\r\nwould never have surfaced.\r\n\r\n            To be useful, The Complete Plain Words and\r\nother books like it must be read through .  Then, when\r\npeople are about to use infer or imply , a small voice\r\nshould whisper, ?I seem to recall that Gower [or\r\nFowler , or some other work, including every medium-sized\r\ndictionary] had something on that,? occasioning\r\na quick look-up that would resolve the question at\r\nonce.  But if people are not humble enough to doubt\r\ntheir own control over the vast complexities of the language\r\nand if, to boot, they are ignorant of the content\r\nof even the most basic available resources, then any\r\nhope of their learning how literate people express\r\nthemselves is lost.\r\n\r\n            Laurence Urdang\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            One Who Goes Everywhere: The Ubiquarian's Dictionary\r\n\r\n            Information specialists, psychologists, brain specialists,\r\nand anyone else who wants to get into the act\r\nhave all speculated on the way the mind works.  To be\r\npersuaded about the myriad possibilities, one need\r\nonly visit a library.  Tucked away in one corner is a\r\ncollection of books on how to improve your memory,\r\nmost of which offer different techniques.  None suggests\r\nplain rote drilling: all suggest a pattern of association,\r\nsome alphabetical, some psychological, some numerical,\r\nand so forth.  Each has validity for the ?kind of\r\nmind? a person has.  Susanna Cuyler's book begins\r\nwith the suggestion ?Make up a sentence, say it aloud.\r\nFor example, Ablaqueate ( to loosen ground around\r\nroots ): `Absalom, come up from the lake and help me\r\nablaqueate.?'  That might work for you, but I would\r\nforget the sentence (especially Absalom, my main association\r\nwith the name being with Chaucer's ribald\r\nMiller's Tale ).\r\n\r\n            Memorizing words is not the point of this book\r\nwhich, in addition to two titles, has a subtitle: ?A\r\nliterary distillation of The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary,\r\nWebster's International , and Mrs. Byrne's Dictionary\r\nof Unusual, Obscure and Preposterous Words .?\r\nThe book is a list of words, with remarkably succinct\r\ndefinitions, that have captured the author's fancy for\r\none reason or another.  Some are interesting and have a\r\ncuriosity value ( spaneria `a scarceness of men'), others,\r\nif learnt, would present some difficulties in fitting into\r\nmost conversations ( umber `sundial pointer's shadow').\r\nLike any written work, this one could stand some improving\r\n( urbicolous `urban domiciled' could, less awkwardly\r\nhave been `city-dwelling').\r\n\r\n            It is not often useful but frequently great fun to\r\nhave at hand a short, attractively packaged list of\r\nweird and wonderful words to carry about in your\r\npocket.  If you agree, send $10 to the address at the top\r\nof this review.  If the photograph on the back cover, of\r\nan extremely attractive lady swinging, Tarzan-like,\r\nthrough the jungle, is of Ms. Cuyler, send your order\r\nin quickly, for she appears to be in sad need of a\r\nwardrobe.\r\n\r\n            Laurence Urdang\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            The Facts On File Encyclopedia of Word and\r\nPhrase Origins\r\n\r\n            This is a good book and an interesting book.  According\r\nto the author's Preface, it covers some 7500\r\nwords and phrases, and its great fault is that it lacks an\r\nindex.  That is to say, there are about 4000 or so main\r\nentries, the rest of the terms being discussed within the\r\nentries; unless they begin with the same letter or\r\nwords, the user will be unable to find them without an\r\nindex.  For example, tsar, tsarina , etc., are discussed at\r\nczar , but there is no cross reference in the Ts for the\r\ntsar words and, if you didn't think (or know) to look\r\nunder czar , you would think them missing.  Publishers\r\nought to learn that they cannot always anticipate the\r\nneeds of users of books and that indexes are almost\r\ninvariably an aid in finding things.\r\n\r\n            My other complaint is about compositors (and\r\nproofreaders) who set loose lines because they do not\r\nknow how to hyphenate the word they have carried\r\nover to a following line.  Today, compositors rely far too\r\nmuch on the automatic hyphenation programs packaged\r\nwith their computer typesetting systems.  A typical\r\nexample occurs (as one might expect) at the entry\r\nfor deipnosophist where a line that normally contains\r\nabout 50 characters (plus spaces), has been printed\r\nwith only 34 characters (plus spaces), mainly, apparently,\r\nbecause no one knew where to hyphen Deipnosophistai ,\r\nthe first word on the next line.  This rather ugly\r\nphenomenon occurs here and there in this otherwise\r\nattractive book.\r\n\r\n            Back to the contents.  General dictionaries give\r\netymologies, albeit brief ones, of most of the words\r\nthey list and fulfill a useful, if limited function.  Extensive\r\nworks, like the Oxford English Dictionary offer far\r\nmore elaborate information, including, where appropriate\r\n(and available) valuable comments on the origins\r\nof sense development.  Etymological dictionaries\r\ndo pretty much the same, though for the most part\r\nthey, like the OED , eschew information about multiword\r\nentries, idiomatic phrases, and such.  Then there\r\nare books, like Funk's A Hog on Ice and my own The\r\nWhole Ball of Wax , that treat the origins of particular\r\nkinds of expressions and, occasionally, words.  Hendrickson's\r\nbook, EWPO for short, covers some standard,\r\nsingle-word entries, some oddities, a number of\r\nphrases and expressions, and a good selection of items\r\nnot covered by most of the other books.\r\n\r\n            Much of what appears is well established; some of\r\nit is speculative, some taken from unreliable sources,\r\nand some at variance with the accepted scholarship.\r\nFor instance, Allen Walker Read's widely accepted etymology\r\nof O.K. is just the reverse of Hendrickson's--the\r\nO.K. of oll korrect was adopted by Van\r\nBuren (?Old Kinderhook?) as a campaign cry, not the\r\nother way round.  At horse latitudes , the author has\r\npicked up the theory that it comes from ? golfo de las\r\nyeguas , `gulf of the mares,' which was the Spanish\r\nname for the ocean between Spain and the Canary\r\nIslands and compares the supposed fickleness of mares\r\nwith the fickle winds in these latitudes.?  As far as I\r\nhave been able to determine, golfo de las yeguas is a\r\ncomplete fiction, for there is no evidence for any such\r\ndesignation in any gazetteer that I could find nor at\r\nthe Royal Geographical Society.  Besides, the horse latitudes\r\nreferred to were in the doldrums, which occur\r\nwest, not east of the Canaries.  I comment on that in\r\nBall of Wax .\r\n\r\n            My current theory runs as follows: the Sargasso\r\nSea, a region northeast of the West Indies, is characterized\r\nas an area of relative calm and an abundance\r\nof sargassum , an entangling seaweed.  As such seaweeds\r\nthrive in the Gulf Stream, they are generally called\r\ngulfweeds .  In all likelihood, the region was originally\r\nknown as golfo del mar in Spanish, that is, `gulf of the\r\nsea,' and was so entered on charts.  English speakers\r\nwho used the charts read mar as mare `female horse,'\r\nwhich was later generalized to horse .  Another possibility\r\nis that the origin was French golfe de la mer or\r\nlatitude de la mer , French mer being quite close in\r\nsound to English mare , which was later generalized to\r\nhorse .  A third possibility is that the waters were populated\r\nby manatees, which might have been likened to\r\nhorses, not too farfetched a suggestion when one considers\r\nthat sailors are said to have imagined them to be\r\nmermaids.  The theory that the horse latitudes were so\r\nnamed because mariners becalmed there threw overboard\r\nthe horses they were transporting because they\r\ndied of thirst or starved seems almost impossible: in\r\norder for such an event to have given rise to horse\r\nlatitudes it would have to have recurred many times,\r\nand it is hard to believe that 16th- and 17th-century\r\nmariners were so improvident as to have allowed that\r\nto happen very often.  Thus, I cannot accept Hendrickson's\r\norigin for horse latitudes , though, to give him his\r\ndue, he only copied the etymology from other sources,\r\nthe OED included.\r\n\r\n            A baker's dozen of other matters:\r\n\r\n            1.  At Hore-Belisha , the information is given that\r\nthe pedestrian crosswalk signals are ?often called Hore-Belishas ?;\r\nin my experience, the term is usually Belisha\r\nbeacon .\r\n\r\n            2.  At heliotrope , some might miss the point without\r\nthe information that Apollo was the Greek god of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n            3.  At guerilla : the usual spelling is guerrilla .  (It\r\ncomes from Spanish guerra `war.')\r\n\r\n            4.  Perhaps the mystery of the origin of the verb\r\ngoose might be cleared up by examining the opening\r\nchapter of Gargantua , by Rabelais.\r\n\r\n            5.  Under gibson cocktail , it is not made with a\r\n?pearl onion? [Ugh!] but with a pickled pearl onion.\r\n\r\n            6.  I have serious doubts about the purported origin\r\nof flea market and its dating to Dutch colonial\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n            7.  The change from numble pie to umble pie to\r\nhumble pie , attributed to ?some anonymous punster in\r\nthe time of William the Conqueror,? was actually due\r\nto the same influences that changed a napron to an\r\napron in the first instance and to the characteristic\r\nweakening of the initial h in English, heard today in\r\nan historical, an hilarious , etc.\r\n\r\n            8.  Coffin nail is a later allusion to `cigarette': in\r\nits earlier metaphoric life it referred to anything that\r\nmight serve to drive one to an early grave; indeed,\r\nsome early Western saloons sold tokens bearing the\r\nwords ?coffin nail? stamped on them which were good\r\nfor a shot of redeye.\r\n\r\n            9.  Humongous is given as ?a term for a huge,\r\nmonstrous person?: it merely means `huge, monstrous'\r\nand, as far as I know, has nothing to do with wrestlers\r\nor, necessarily, people.\r\n\r\n            10.  At hung higher than Gilderoy's kite the author\r\nglosses kite as `body'; it is actually a word for `belly.'\r\n\r\n            11.  There is a theory that the curious expression\r\n(from the Bible), It is harder for a rich man to enter the\r\nkingdom of heaven than for a camel to go through the\r\neye of a needle results from a misreading of the original:\r\nthe original, it is said, has a word meaning `rope,'\r\nnot `camel,' which makes sense (to me).  I cannot insist\r\nthat Hendrickson accept the theory, but he ought at\r\nleast to have acknowledged its existence; instead, we are\r\ntold that ancient Middle Eastern walled towns had a\r\nrear gate called the Needle's Eye through which a camel\r\ncould pass only if kneeling down.  How camels move\r\nforward while kneeling is not explained--perhaps, pace\r\nSeattle--that is (also) the true origin of skid row .\r\n\r\n            12.  Comments like ?The cuckoo was so named for\r\nthe one-note song it repeats over and over? came from\r\nsomeone who has never heard the bird's disyllabic call.\r\n\r\n            13.  At Eggs Benedict we learn that Oscar of the\r\nWaldorf concocted the modern dish on the inspiration\r\nof a Samuel Benedict who ordered something similar\r\nas a hangover cure.  Oscar is credited with having introduced\r\nthe use of English muffins to the recipe in\r\n1894, which I find somewhat anachronistic as they\r\n(being neither English nor muffins) did not exist before\r\nthe mid 1920s.\r\n\r\n            A glance at the ?Most Frequently Cited Authorities?\r\nreveals the possible source(s) of some of these\r\naberrations: Partridge's Origins and Shipley's Dictionary\r\nof Word Origins are two of the most notorious\r\nsources of misinformation on etymology.  Moreover,\r\nSlang and Its Analogues is attributed to John S.\r\nFarmer and W. E. ?Hurley,? the latter's name being,\r\nproperly, Henley.  It would appear, then, that Hendrickson\r\nhas combined his sources for any information\r\nhe could glean, repeating indiscriminately his choices\r\nof that which is most colorful.  If you have occasion to\r\nrefer to this work, it would be well to keep in mind\r\nthat it can be relied on for picturesque etymologies but\r\nnot, necessarily, accurate ones.\r\n\r\n            Laurence Urdang\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Kangaroo's Comments & Wallaby's Words\r\n            This useful book is divided into three main parts:\r\npages 21 to 130 consist of eight chapters of text dealing\r\nwith various aspects of (Australian) life and flora and\r\nfauna; there follow two glossaries-cum-index, one in\r\nwhich Australianisms are translated into American\r\nEnglish, the other listing American words and expressions\r\nwith their Australian equivalents; both give references\r\nto the chapters in which they are treated.  The\r\ndifficulty with the reference system is that one cannot\r\ntell where to find Chapter 4, say, till he leafs through\r\nto the end of 3 or the beginning of 5.  It would have\r\nhelped to have given the chapter numbers in running\r\nheads at the book's foredge.\r\n\r\n            Another objection is that the terms identified as\r\nAustralian are not, necessarily, exclusively so.  For example,\r\nserviette, scone, sheila, sister, Smarties, spanner,\r\nspot on, squash, starkers , just to pick a handful, are\r\nBriticisms; although the author makes that clear, it\r\nseems odd that the words and expressions that are direct\r\nborrowings from British English are not individually\r\nidentified as such.  That, however, is not the purpose of\r\nthe book, so it might seem carping of me to bring it up.\r\nAlso, as the author acknowledges, ?This is not meant to\r\nbe a definitive lexicon of Australian-English,? a true\r\nenough statement even without the extraneous hyphen.\r\n\r\n            Although the text makes clear the nature of things\r\nlike sausage rolls (? minced (ground up) sausage meat\r\nwrapped in pastry, fried, then kept warm for takeaway?),\r\nthe Glossary identifies them as ?takeout\r\nsnack,? which would mislead the casual reader (of the\r\nGlossary) to infer that all takeout snacks are called\r\nsausage rolls .\r\n\r\n            These criticisms having been made, Kangaroo's\r\nComments is nonetheless an interesting, rather well-done\r\nguide to the Australianisms it covers, and travelers\r\ndown under would be well advised to use it.  It\r\nmight also prove useful to those who cannot understand\r\nPaul Hogan's films (or commercials).\r\n\r\n            Laurence Urdang\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Verbal Analogies I--Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Remember proportions?  ?Ten is to five as twenty is\r\nto ten; 10/5 = 20/10; 10:5:: 20:10, etc.??
