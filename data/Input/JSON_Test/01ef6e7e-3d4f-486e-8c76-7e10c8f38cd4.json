Also, as long as I'm on parochial issues, it is freezing cold\r\nhere, and the radiators in my apartment are making those knocking and\r\nwhispering noises that make all prewar buildings in Manhattan seem like they\r\nwere built on Native American graveyards. Furthermore, there is yet another\r\nOp-Ed piece in the New York Times today on the Brooklyn Museum show,\r\nthis one by Philippe de Montebello, in which he characterizes the works on\r\ndisplay there as by artists \"who deserve to remain obscure or be forgotten,\"\r\nboldly opining, \"I have seen the exhibition, and I think the emperor has no\r\nclothes.\" Strong words for a man whose institution not long ago devoted a\r\nheavily promoted show to the designs of Gianni Versace featuring such\r\nculturally important artifacts as the famous safety-pin-adorned dress worn by\r\nElizabeth Hurley to, I believe, the premiere of Four Weddings and a\r\nFuneral .\r\n\r\n            I like your conspiracy theory, but where most such theories fall apart on\r\nthe unlikelihood of the conspirators being sufficiently organized to carry off\r\nsuch a thing, yours falls apart on the unlikelihood of any alternative\r\ncandidate's being sufficiently disorganized not to understand the benefits of\r\nserving the interests of corporate oil. Also, while I don't like to quibble, I\r\ndon't think W. is a self-admitted cokehead. Did you happen to catch Sam\r\nDonaldson's interview with a tearful George Bush senior on 20/20 last\r\nnight? I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that you frequently see\r\ngrittier reporting on VH1's Behind the Music , especially the part where\r\nBush was so overcome with emotion while reading a letter he wrote to a\r\n7-year-old girl whose father had been killed in battle during his\r\nadministration that he was unable to continue, and had to hand the task over to\r\nthe Donaldson (on 20/20 --that's never happened on Behind the\r\nMusic , although I didn't watch every minute of the one on Poison, so you\r\nnever know).\r\n\r\n            I think Pok?mon are adorable, and also don't want to hear any more bad words\r\nabout those Gap ads. I like those Gap ads, because I always feel\r\nsympathy for the zombie-like teen.\r\n\r\n            This morning I read your Mojo memoir of playing to 70,000 baffled\r\nrock fans in Hyde Park as a member of the Deviants in 1969. I particularly\r\nenjoyed the picture of you wearing a very 1969 garment that makes you look like\r\na giant amphetamine-crazed Q-Tip. What the hell is that thing? What were you\r\ngoing to say about David Bowie? I interviewed him recently, and found him to\r\nhave a charm so forceful that it was akin to encountering a major climatic\r\ncondition, which surprisingly few of the professionally famous do. In fact, if\r\nthere is a sad thing to know about interviewing artists whose work you admire,\r\nit is that their work may well be the only thing about them you do. Also, the\r\nrecord that came out yesterday is very good.\r\n\r\n            Have you had any coverage out there of Donald Trump's possible presidential\r\ncandidacy, or is that just a New York story? Now, there's a man who understands\r\nthe benefits of corporate oil, since I don't see how he could get his hair to\r\nstay like that without liberal applications of it.\r\n\r\n            Love,\r\nMim\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
