Issue 2 is Democratic presidential politics, including Al\r\nGore and Bill Bradley's promise to allow open gays in the military.\r\n\r\n            Most pundits agree that the revelation of John McCain's influence-peddling\r\nletter to the FCC has hurt his campaign, although several--including Paul Gigot\r\n(PBS's NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ) and Tucker Carlson (CNN's\r\nLate Edition )--think that McCain is just defending his\r\nconstituents, as he was elected to do. Pundits disagree on Bush's sweeping\r\ntax-cut proposal. Joe Klein (NBC's Meet the\r\nPress ) notes that the cut is bigger than the congressional GOP's\r\n(doomed) proposal last fall, and Al Hunt (CNN's Capital Gang ) and David Broder (PBS's Washington Week in\r\nReview ) think that New Hampshire voters care more about schools and\r\nhealth care than taxes. Mark Shields ( NewsHour ) remarks that Jack\r\nKemp's aggressive tax-cutting campaign strategy didn't work in the 1988 GOP\r\nprimary, but his colleague, Gigot, responds that McCain's emphasis on tax-cut\r\nmoderation apes the failed electoral strategies of George Bush (in 1980) and\r\nBob Dole (in 1988). On Meet the Press , Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a\r\nMcCain supporter, thinks that McCain's critique that Bush's tax plan as too\r\nlarge is not working. John McLaughlin, Lawrence Kudlow, and Jim Warren (all of\r\nPBS's McLaughlin Group ) enthuse over Bush's recent debate\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\n            Many pundits--including Mara Liasson ( Washington Week ), Mark\r\nShields ( NewsHour and Capital Gang ), Sam Donaldson (ABC's\r\nThis Week ), and Paul Begala (MSNBC coverage of\r\nFriday's night's GOP debate)--think that Gore's and Bradley's outspoken\r\nadvocacy of gays in the military will hurt them in the general election. Paul\r\nGigot ( NewsHour ) and Steve Roberts ( Late Edition ) contrast\r\nGore's ideological approach to this issue with President Clinton's pragmatic\r\napproach. Tucker Carlson ( Late Edition ) notes that only a nation with\r\nno security threats could devote so much attention to a \"boutique issue\" like\r\nthe military's homosexual policy. George Stephanopoulos and George F. Will\r\n(both of This Week ) think the issue is a red herring, because Congress\r\ncan override any executive order that overturns \"don't ask, don't tell.\"\r\nMargaret Carlson ( Capital Gang ) and Joe Klein say that Bradley's\r\naloofness and condescension still hurt his popularity, and Klein predicts that\r\nif he is the Democratic nominee his Senate votes against the Gulf War and\r\nwelfare reform will haunt him.\r\n\r\nMiscellany: John McLaughlin, Jim Warren, and Eleanor Clift (of\r\nthe McLaughlin Group ) call the new criterion for participating in\r\ngeneral-election presidential debates \"undemocratic.\" (A participant must have\r\nat least 15 percent support in five national polls.) They argue that any party\r\nqualifying for federal matching funds should get to participate. On\r\nFox News\r\nSunday , Bill Bradley also voices disagreement with the rule, saying\r\nthat the Reform Party has a \"strong case\" that it should be included in the\r\ndebates, even without 15 percent support. On CBS's Face the Nation ,\r\nGov. Jesse Ventura, Ref.-Minn., notes that he had only 10 percent support when\r\nhe debated Minnesota's Democratic and Republican candidates for governor; six\r\nweeks later he won the election with 37 percent. ... On Friday's Larry King\r\nLive (CNN), both Bob and Elizabeth Dole say that the general election will\r\nbe close, not a blowout by Bush. Appearing with his wife again on This\r\nWeek , Bob Dole predicts that Bush will win the nomination (although he\r\nstill will not endorse him). Steve Roberts opines that although Mrs. Dole has\r\nproved to be an awful presidential campaigner, her popularity among women will\r\nbe hard for Bush to resist when he selects his running mate. ... When Elizabeth\r\nDole praises Bush's \"executive experience\" on This Week , Sam Donaldson\r\npoints out that her own husband had no such experience when he ran for\r\npresident.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Last Word\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Look, I've always had two principles. One is make bureaucracies react on\r\nbehalf of the taxpayers, and second, do whatever I can to increase competition\r\nand lower costs in telecommunications. Those are the guiding principles I've\r\nhad. Today, we are asking the federal government to release all correspondence\r\nthat I've had with every government agency. But finally, let me remind you, I'm\r\nthe chairman of the committee that is designated by the Congress to oversight\r\n[sic] the FCC. And it's my responsibility to try to see and make them act. And\r\nso I believe that the record will be clear that I've done that on behalf of the\r\nconsumer.\r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\n                  --John McCain ( Face the Nation )\r\n\r\n
