Not only was the\r\nmentioning of a man's (or woman's) leg taboo, but\r\nthe garment covering it was also forbidden to be\r\nspoken of in polite conversation.  In modern dialogue,\r\nwhich in no sense approaches the gentility of\r\nthe perfumed puritanicals, the denotation of unmentionables\r\nhas broadened to include body organs,\r\ncurses, and biological functions.  How clever it is,\r\nthough, that metaphor, the great facilitating factor in\r\nthe changing of word meanings, has carefully camouflaged\r\nthe unmentionables of the current day.\r\n\r\n            Consider the following vignette, apparently\r\nvoid of any hint of an unmentionable:\r\n\r\n            Mrs. Eleanor Sutherland, the vivacious wife of\r\nthe petroleum magnate, H. R. Sutherland, is hosting\r\na midsummer patio brunch with her friend of many a\r\nsocial season, Grace Walthum, wife of Sam Walthum,\r\nconsidered by many to be the richest man in the\r\nstate, in honor of Sandra Chapman, the young Illinois\r\ndebutante and intended wife of Tom Weed, Republican\r\ncandidate for governor.\r\n\r\n            ?Girls, the treat for this morning is avocado finger\r\nsandwiches.  Fanny made them for the first time\r\nlast week, and H. R. thought they were simply\r\nsumptuous.  Only today, she made them with German\r\npumpernickel.  I do hope you like them.?\r\n\r\n            ?Oh, Eleanor, you must pencil this off for me on\r\none of your personalized recipe cards.  These are\r\npurely delicious.  Don't you agree, Sandra??\r\n\r\n            ?Indeed, I do.  I might serve them as hors\r\nd'oeuvres for Tom's political science seminar at the\r\nuniversity next week.?\r\n\r\n            ?You two are testimony enough for Fanny's culinary\r\npowers, although I do detest her slicing the\r\nbread so thick.  After finishing off the sandwiches,\r\nwe'll savor some vanilla mousse.?\r\n\r\n            ?That's a lovely centerpiece of bachelor's buttons\r\nand cowslips, Eleanor.  Wherever did you find\r\nsuch exquisite flowers??\r\n\r\n            ?Yes, and the cubicle you have them arranged\r\nin is just gorgeous.?\r\n\r\n            ?Oh, Frank, the gardener, grew them on the\r\nfront lawn.  He's hoping to have mistletoe by Christmas,\r\nand if the spring orchids don't fizzle, Sandra\r\ncan use them in her nuptial ceremony.  By the way,\r\nSandra, where will you and Tom honeymoon??\r\n\r\n            ?We're going to spend two weeks in the Grand\r\nTetons.  Then we're off to the ocean where Tom says\r\nhe's going to swim stark nude.  Would you believe\r\nit??\r\n\r\n            At this moment, there is a disturbing noise\r\nnearby.\r\n\r\n            ?Jeepers creepers, Eleanor, what is that whirring\r\ncommotion??\r\n\r\n            ?Why, Grace, look across the lawn to the orchard.\r\nIt's a feisty covey of flatulent partridges taking\r\nflight.  Aren't they beautiful, girls??\r\n\r\n            ?Tom's greyhound would certainly think they\r\nwere a beautiful sight.?\r\n\r\n            ?My, how the time has slipped away.  We must\r\nbe going, Sandra.?\r\n\r\n            ?Of course, we must, and Mrs. Sutherland, I\r\nhave so enjoyed being a part of such a stimulating\r\nconversation.?\r\n\r\n            ?Girls, it was my deepest pleasure.  Please do\r\ncome again.?\r\n\r\n            Actually, in the preceding dialogue, three ladies\r\nfrom the highest level of society can be cited for\r\ninnocently mentioning the unmentionables in no less\r\nthan twenty-plus instances, to wit:\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Avocado was borrowed from Spanish and was\r\noriginally spelled aguacate .  The word's origin is Nahuatl\r\nahuacatl , a word meaning `testicle,' because of\r\nthe similarity of the shape of the fruit.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Pumpernickel was borrowed directly from German,\r\na compound of pumpern `to fart' and Nickel the\r\n`devil.'  The allusion could be to a hand slapping the\r\nloaf, thereby producing a deep, hollow, fartlike\r\nsound.  On the other hand (pun intended), the root\r\nsense might be implying the bread is so hard to digest\r\nit would make the devil fart.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Pencil (as well as penicillin ) was borrowed from\r\nLatin p?nicillus `paintbrush,' a diminutive of peniculus\r\n`brush,' which is also a diminutive of penis , which\r\nin Latin (also) meant `tail.'  Figuratively, a brush is a\r\npenis is a tail.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Seminar came through German from Latin\r\ns?min?rium `plant nursery.'  The word's ultimate origin\r\nis Latin semen `seed.'  Since the testicles are producers\r\nof semen, they are often referred to in slang\r\nas seed .\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Testimony and detest are both based on Latin\r\ntestis `witness, testicle.'  In the final analysis, a man\r\ncan only witness to his virility by his testicles.  The\r\nroot sense of testimony , then, is `a laying of the testes\r\non the evidence table' and of detest is to `hate to the\r\nextent of losing one's testicles.'\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Vanilla , extracted from the seedpods of a tropical\r\nplant, was borrowed from Spanish vainilla , which\r\ndenoted the flower, the pod, or the flavoring.  Spanish\r\nhad formed vainilla from vaina `sheath,' a word it\r\nhad borrowed from Latin v?gina `sheath for a\r\nsword.' Later, vagina was borrowed into English\r\nand assigned its present meaning from the similarity\r\nof the functions.\r\n\r\n            Bachelor's buttons, a term that denotes a plant\r\nwith spherical-shaped flowers, was created as a metaphor\r\nof the male testes.\r\n\r\n            Cowslip is not ?cow's lip.?  It is from Old English\r\nc?slyppe `cow manure,' literally, `cow slip.'  The\r\nflower is aptly named, since it grows well in profusely\r\nmanured pastures.\r\n\r\n            Cubicle is from Latin cub?re `to bend over in\r\npreparation for sexual activity.'  The word now\r\ndesignates a space so small a person might be required\r\nto bend over to enter it.\r\n\r\n            In its root sense, mistletoe is the `bird-shit\r\nplant.'  The word is cognate with Old High German\r\nmist `manure, shit, dung.'  The seed of the plant was\r\ndispensed in the dung of birds.\r\n\r\n            Orchid is from the Greek orchis `testicle.'  The\r\nflower was so called by Pliny the Elder because the\r\ndouble root resembled two hairy testicles.\r\n\r\n            Fizzle is probably from Middle English fisten `to\r\nfart.'  In 1532 the word is recorded with the meaning\r\nto `fart noiselessly.'\r\n\r\n            The Grand Tetons is a mountain range in Wyoming.\r\nThey were coarsely named from their root\r\nsense, `big tits,' from French teton `tit,' because of\r\ntheir shape.\r\n\r\n            Stark nude is euphemistic for stark naked.  The\r\nterm was originally start naked (Middle English stert,\r\nfrom Old English steart `tail, ass') and is preserved in\r\nredstart `bird with red tail feathers.'\r\n\r\n            Jeepers creepers is nothing other than a euphemistic\r\ncover-up for the curse Jesus Christ.  The term\r\nwas actually used as early as 1937.\r\n\r\n            Feisty, like fizzle, began as Middle English fysten,\r\nfisten `to fart.' At one time, fysting curre referred\r\nto a stinking dog, and feist named a small dog\r\nof mixed breed.\r\n\r\n            Covey, like cubicle, is from Latin cub?re `to bend\r\nover for sexual purposes.' The word came through\r\nMiddle French cover `to incubate.'\r\n\r\n            Flatulent ?having stomach gas? came through\r\nFrench from Latin flatus `a farting.'\r\n\r\n            Partridge came through Old French and Latin\r\nperd?cem, from Greek p?rd?x `partridge,' which is\r\nrelated to p?rdesthai `to fart.'  The partridge is a\r\n?farting bird? because of the noise made by its being\r\nflushed.\r\n\r\n            Finally, the first element of greyhound probably\r\nmeans `bitch.'  Old Icelandic greyhundr is `bitch\r\nhound.'\r\n\r\n            Most will agree that euphemism is an acceptable\r\nmeans of avoiding the unmentionables, unutterables,\r\ninexplicables, ineffables, inexpressibles, and\r\nwhatever else they have been called.  While it is the\r\nfunction of metaphor to conceal the unmentionables,\r\nit is likewise the pleasurable business of etymology\r\nto expose them.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n?Every minute was more exciting than the next.?\r\n[From an on-camera interview with Linda Evans, commenting\r\non ?Night of 100 Stars? party in New York to\r\npromote ?Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous.?]\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n?Best Place In Town To Take A Leak.? [From an advertisement\r\nof Conn. Auto Radiator, Inc. in a local television\r\nprogram guide, ]\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Wrenches in the Gorse and Bracken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            It began innocently enough, without guile on my part.  We were traveling on an interstate through\r\nflat, scraggly country.  Nothing seemed to grow at\r\nthe roadside except dry, brownish, stalky, weedy\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\n            ?What're those bushes, daddy?? a child\r\nwhined.\r\n\r\n            ?Gorse,? I said absently.\r\n\r\n            ?Gorse?? said my wife, raising an eyebrow.\r\n\r\n            ?Well, then, what's that?? She pointed to a patch of\r\nequally depressing but bushier shrubbery.\r\n\r\n            ?Bracken,? I said serenely.\r\n\r\n            I had, I now believe, been reading an English\r\nnovel, or perhaps a Sherlock Holmes adventure, and\r\nso the words just popped out of my subconscious.\r\nYou know, in English novels people and large\r\nhounds are always chasing about on desolate moors,\r\namid gorse and bracken.  I hadn't the foggiest\r\nidea--and haven't to this day--what gorse and\r\nbracken look like.\r\n\r\n            ?Gorse and bracken,? my wife mused.  ?Ah yes,\r\none of the great teams of the Golden Age of comedy.\r\nLaurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Gorse and\r\nBracken.?\r\n\r\n            ?Gorse and bracken, gorse and bracken,?\r\nchanted the children gleefully.\r\n\r\n            A bit farther down the road we halted for lunch\r\nat a roadside rest stop.  My youngest pointed to a\r\nbird and said: ?What's that, daddy??\r\n\r\n            Perhaps I was thinking of car repairs, for the\r\nengine had been making odd noises.  Whatever the\r\nreason, without a blink I replied: ?It's a Wrench.?\r\nThe lie came to my lips just as easily as to the lips of\r\nJoseph Goebbels.  Then, to my horror, without waiting\r\nfor another childish question, I pointed to a\r\ncrawling caterpillar and said glibly, ?Look.  There's\r\na Squirm.?\r\n\r\n            I had embarked on a life of deceit involving the\r\nnames of nature's own flora and fauna.  Perhaps I\r\nhad an unconscious recollection of seeing, long ago,\r\nJames Thurber's delightful drawings of such creatures\r\nas The Dudgeon and The Barefaced Lie in his\r\n?A New Natural History.?  If so, I didn't make the\r\nconnection for years, and prefer to believe that great\r\nminds,... et cetera.\r\n\r\n            Anyway, to my kids, all bushes became Gorse\r\nand Bracken.  All birds were Wrenches.  Worms,\r\nsnakes, and such were Squirms.  I didn't disillusion\r\nthem.  Instead, I confess with shame, I found that\r\nmerely misleading my children was not enough.\r\nSince I lived in South Florida, where real tropical\r\nexotica abound (poisonous toads, walking catfish,\r\ntwo-foot-long green lizards from Cuba, etc.) it was\r\neasy to flummox visitors.\r\n\r\n            ?Gosh,? my brother-in-law said, peering apprehensively\r\ninto the dark of my back yard, a subtropical\r\njungle, ?it sounds like we're in Africa.  What's\r\nthat ... growly sort of chirping sound??\r\n\r\n            ?I believe that's a Strike,? I said.  ?A bird related\r\nto the macaw.? Cupping a hand to my good\r\near, I added, ?Yes, I'm sure of it.  A common Strike.\r\nIt has a predatory cousin, the Preemptive Strike.?\r\n\r\n            ?Is that so?? my brother-in-law muttered, with\r\nsome awe in his voice.\r\n\r\n            Visitors from the North always demanded a visit\r\nto the nearby tourist attraction, a lush, tropical paradise\r\npopulated by trained parrots and alligators and\r\ncolorful insects and such.  So I took them.\r\n\r\n            ?See that curious little beast over there?? I said,\r\npointing.  ?That's a Peccadillo.  His armor, like a\r\nshell, over most of its body, and great long claws to\r\ndig in the ground.  And there, climbing that tree--\r\nthe big blue lizard, see it?--that's an Orthodontia.\r\nThe striped one--see it?--is a Pharisee.  Or, wait,\r\nmaybe that's a Paraphrase.  Whatever.  It's larger\r\nthan the Stentorian at any rate.?\r\n\r\n            With practice, I became bolder, mixing in the\r\nnames of real flora and fauna.\r\n\r\n            ?A neighbor of ours used to own a ring-tailed\r\ncoatimundi,? I said.  ?It would escape and climb our\r\nFicus Benjamina.  Look out, don't step on the Bufo\r\nMarinus.?  Then, without missing a beat, I continued:\r\n\r\n            ?See those leafy things there?  That's Impetigo.\r\nThe feathery thing is Implicit.  And the vine growing\r\nbeside it is Thorax.  It's sort of like poison ivy so\r\ndon't touch.  You'll break out in a rash.  The flowering\r\nbush is Divertissement.  And that bristly thing is\r\na Septum.  One variety of Septum has been genetically\r\nmutated by exposure to radon in the soil; it's\r\ncalled the Deviated Septum.?  Without a blush I\r\neyed ground-hugging plants and reeled off their\r\nnames: Hex, Ponder, Explicit, and Envy.\r\n\r\n            ?See the ground cover with the yellow blossoms??\r\nI said.  ?It's Regalia.?\r\n\r\n            I was delighted to answer questions about butterflies,\r\nbirds, and creepy crawly things:\r\n\r\n            ?Yes, that's an Utter Gall.  And there in a row\r\nare a Sheer Audacity, a Wretched Excess, and a Cistern.\r\nI had hoped we'd see a Damnable Outrage but\r\nthey usually hole up in the daytime; there might be\r\none hiding there in that patch of Philanthropy.  The\r\norange one is a Flirtatious Glance and, look, the little\r\none hiding behind that bed of Logic is the Furtive\r\nGlance.  That one in the ferns is a Connubial\r\nBliss.  The fern itself is Lurch.?\r\n\r\n            Touring the tourist attraction's aviary--in\r\nwhich the birds flew free while visitors strolled in a\r\nglass tunnel--I hit my stride.\r\n\r\n            ?The big blue wading bird is a Shrift.  The\r\nsmaller one there is the Short Shrift.  There's a flock\r\nof Cognitive Verbs and a pair of Light-Hearted Banters.\r\nThe one zipping around in circles is an Orbital\r\nSander, and the drab little creature making those sad\r\nchirps is a Plain Brown Wrapper.?\r\n\r\n            At the nearby zoo, I was quick to point out the\r\nUtter Gall, a burrowing marsupial similar to the Unmitigated\r\nGall, and the horned mountain dwellers,\r\nthe Apex and the Pharynx.  Back at home, sitting on\r\nthe terrace listening to the evening sounds, I would\r\ninvariably inform our visitors that many of South\r\nFlorida's indigenous species are scarce now.\r\n\r\n            ?When we first moved here, a covey of Ruffled\r\nGrouch lived right over there in that hedge of Presumption,\r\nbut no more.  And Visage, Expletive, and\r\nArticulate used to grow wild. Now...? and I\r\nlaughed harshly, ?now only the garden catalogues\r\nhave them.  And Expletive has even been deleted\r\nfrom those.?\r\n\r\n            I suspect that many visitors were so overwhelmed\r\nwith the tropical heat that they didn't pay\r\nclose enough attention.  Or perhaps it was my habit\r\nof feeding them industrial strength Martinis before I\r\nbegan my nature lessons.\r\n\r\n            One of my visitors, however, listened solemnly\r\nto my spiel, then presented me with a card.  It said:\r\n\r\n\r\nMembership in the Indoor Bird Watchers is\r\ngranted to those who have identified the following\r\nbirds through the bottom of a Martini glass,\r\nwhile seated--The Extra-Marital Lark, the Great\r\nAmerican Regret, the Morning Grouse, the After-Dinner\r\nPee Wee, the Double-Breasted Seersucker,\r\nand the Rosy-Breasted Pushover.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            I had been checked and mated at my own game.\r\nBut that didn't stop me.  I remain addicted to my\r\nMiami vice, although torn by the knowledge that all\r\nover the country are innocent children, naive relatives,\r\nand perplexed winter visitors, all telling their\r\nfriends and families about the wildlife I showed them\r\nin Florida.\r\n\r\n            Guilt can't stop me, of course.  Like any other\r\naddict, I can't wait for my next fix.  Come on down,\r\ny'all, I want to take you out in the yard and point out\r\nthe Wretched Excess, the Ingratiating Manner, the\r\nHesitant Smile, and the Sheer Audacity.  There's a\r\nVeritable Shambles right beside the front steps, and\r\nby the fish pond you can spot a Receptacle, an Incipient\r\nQuarrel, and a Fidget.  And look up; there goes\r\na Smote, circling in the air.  I think it's hunting an\r\nApparent Hoax.  See, there's one now, crawling under\r\nthat bed of Xerox.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            Laurence Urdang's comments on ?politically\r\ncorrect? language reminded me of a television interview\r\non a network morning program the day after\r\n?Dances With Wolves? won several Academy\r\nawards.  Live from the Pine Ridge reservation in\r\nSouth Dakota, the (Anglo) interviewer was very\r\ncareful to refer to ?Native Americans.?  The interviewees\r\nconsistently referred to themselves as ?Indians.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Cross-talk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Searching for some refreshment in an unfamiliar\r\ntown, I came across a luncheonette with this\r\nsign in the window: ?HOT? COFFEE.  I stared at the\r\nsign for a moment.  Something about the quotation\r\nmarks made the coffee suspect, the way a real estate\r\nagent will call a closet a ?room.?  Since I didn't feel\r\nlike drinking a tepid beverage, I walked until I got to\r\na diner that served me an acceptable cup of java.\r\nThere on the menu was listed ?FRESH? EGGS.  The\r\npurpose was obviously to highlight, to emphasize,\r\nbut I would argue that these places are only hurting\r\ntheir business.  Scare-quotes, as they are sometimes\r\ncalled, call into question the very words they assert.\r\n\r\n            These are examples in which the wording undercuts\r\nitself, yet without any apparent sarcasm.\r\nThere are those who argue that it is simply a case of\r\nlanguage calling attention to itself, as Steven Short\r\nnoted in a letter to VERBATIM fifteen years ago.\r\nOther readers, such as Jon Mills and Pat Solotaire,\r\nshowed outright suspicion of entrees like ?Roast\r\nbeef with `gravy' ? and a liquid soap boasting\r\n? `Contains No Phosphates!' ?  The basic meaning\r\ndoes not shift, but somehow its implications turn\r\nagainst it.  The effect is generally unintentional, like\r\ntwo people talking at cross-purposes--so I decided\r\nto call this phenomenon ?cross-talk.?\r\n\r\n            Soon after that, I discovered another kind of\r\ncross-talk, which has the insidious effect of undercutting\r\nnot itself but all related instances.  I was in\r\nthe supermarket, buying dessert.  ?We use only the\r\nfinest ingredients,? read the label on one ice cream\r\nbrand.  This seems like a simple statement, what the\r\nlinguistic philosopher J. L. Austin termed a constative\r\nutterance: a base level of communication, with\r\nno metaphor or secondary meanings attached.  But\r\nconsider the implications of the label: most other ice\r\ncream makers cut costs by using mediocre contents.\r\nThe wording thus has an extended or connotative\r\naspect to it, becoming what Austin called a performative\r\nutterance.  In fact, many manufacturers use this\r\nkind of wording as a polite way of discrediting their\r\nrivals.  The impact of this seemingly nonassertive\r\nlanguage is such that the Federal Drug Administration\r\nhas recently banned the ?No Cholesterol? label\r\non foods that never had cholesterol anyway.  The\r\nunfair inference is that somehow the manufacturer\r\nhas reduced the cholesterol, or that other brands\r\nstill contain a lot of it.  The increasingly common\r\nclaims ?All Natural? and ?Fresh? have a similar effect\r\nand are also coming under federal scrutiny.  But\r\nthe investigation should really go beyond the supermarket:\r\nwhen a jewelry store that does ear-piercing\r\nadvertises, ?We sterilize all our instruments,? is it\r\nnot hinting something unsavory about other establishments?\r\n\r\n            What accounts for the pernicious effects of\r\ncross-talk?  Cross-talk seems to be a cousin of irony,\r\ngiving a result opposite to what is seemingly intended.\r\nThe difficulty arises in trying to say what\r\nkind of irony cross-talk resembles.  Irony of statement,\r\nor sarcasm, seems close: exclaiming, ?What a\r\nsurprise!?  over a drearily foregone conclusion, for\r\nexample.  But consider when a little child tells his\r\nfather, ?We're going to surprise you with a birthday\r\nparty tomorrow afternoon!? There is no irony of\r\nstatement intended here, yet the sentence neatly\r\ndefeats its purpose.  A clue may be offered by dramatic\r\nirony, in which the audience knows what the\r\nspeaker is unaware of.  Does the cross-talk in the\r\nbirthday-surprise announcement derive from the select\r\naudience, who knows that the speaker is sabotaging\r\nhis meaning?  Situational irony need not involve\r\nlanguage at all, just an action that achieves the\r\nopposite effect of the intention.  Maybe this is where\r\nthe bulk of cross-talk belongs, though it needs an\r\naudience to apprehend it correctly, which makes it\r\nalso linked to dramatic irony.\r\n\r\n            The truth is that cross-talk may at times resemble\r\nall three ironies, depending on the intent, audience,\r\nand effect.  And since only irony of statement\r\nis deliberate, the effects of cross-talk range from accidental\r\nto purposeful.  Praeteritio , that sly rhetorical\r\ndevice of mentioning what one is passing over,\r\nbelongs to this category of cross-talk: ?That goes\r\nwithout saying? covers up the obvious need to say it,\r\nand ?I will pass over the topic of my opponent's\r\nadultery? should be recognizable as the ploy it is.\r\nBut then there are instances where the degree of\r\ndislocation is unclear.  Does the common capper to a\r\nbrief business conversation, ?Let's do lunch sometime,?\r\nsignify an upcoming meal or a polite brushoff?\r\n\r\n            Let me illustrate the intricacies involved: I recently\r\nreceived a card from an academic journal acknowledging\r\nan essay I had submitted.  They were\r\nholding it for further consideration.  The last sentence\r\nread: ?We assume, of course, that you have\r\nnot submitted this essay elsewhere.?  Is this sarcasm?\r\nAlmost certainly not.  Yet once again the implications\r\nrun counter to the wording and tone.  The\r\nurbane assume and of course finesse the real meaning\r\nof the sentence, i.e., ?We are worried that you\r\nmay have indeed submitted this essay elsewhere.?\r\nThe message is all the more urgent because its mere\r\npresence hints that would-be contributors often do\r\nsubmit the same essay to more than one journal simultaneously.\r\n\r\n            The most perplexing species of cross-talk remains\r\nthe unintentional reversal.  In a recent advertisement\r\nfor the luxuriously quiet Lincoln Town Car,\r\nJack Nicklaus is trying to make a putt, but cannot\r\nbecause of the noise of the spectators.  Through the\r\nmiracle of television, all of them are crowded inside\r\nthe car with the windows shut, resulting in utter silence.\r\nNicklaus takes a swing: the ball rolls to the lip\r\nof the cup, where it stops.  Suddenly someone inside\r\nthe car sneezes, and the ball slips into the hole.  It is\r\na funny moment, but what does it imply?  That the\r\nnew car is not really quiet?  That quiet is not always\r\nsuch a good idea, anyway?  And do not both ideas\r\nrun counter to the advertising pitch?\r\n\r\n            We may mean what we say, but do we always say\r\nwhat we mean?  A friend of mine once tried to sell his\r\nold car by parking it in his yard with a sticker that\r\nread ?FOR SALE: $300.?  He couldn't understand why\r\nno one showed any interest, until a passerby told him\r\nany car that cheap had to be a lemon.  He promptly\r\nchanged the price to $700 and sold it the next day.\r\nThis story shows that interpretation is all important,\r\nas in cheap meaning `inexpensive' to some people and\r\n`shoddy' to others.  To return to Austin's distinction\r\nbetween constative and performative utterances:\r\nAustin eventually concluded correctly that there are\r\nno purely constative utterances.  The simplest sentence,\r\nsuch as ?I am a woman,? can have secondary\r\nmeanings in certain contexts: for example, ?I wish I\r\nwere a man? or ?Thank God I'm not a man.? In the\r\nbroadest sense, then, any language is potentially\r\ncross-talk, given a suitable situation, just as any utterance\r\nmay become ironic.  Meaning is not as stable as\r\nwe might like it to be.\r\n\r\n            At times, the simplest wording can cross up the\r\nreader.  Last week, I was stopped at a traffic light\r\nwith a sign underneath that read, ?RIGHT ON RED\r\nAFTER STOP.? Since I live where right turns at a red\r\nlight are permitted, first I did not think much about\r\nit.  The sign just seemed superfluous.  But then it\r\noccurred to me: why was the notice there at all?  I\r\nstared at the sign for a moment, and I realized that\r\nthe words in a way implied their opposite; that is, a\r\nright turn at a red light is not allowed in this district--except\r\nhere.  In the end, I spent so much time\r\npondering the implications of the wording that I\r\nmissed two traffic light changes, and cars started to\r\nhonk behind me.\r\n\r\n            Here is a real cautionary tale.  For years, a sign\r\nalong Route 80 in New Jersey near the George\r\nWashington Bridge flashed a ?BEST ROUTE? arrow to\r\nindicate the road with the least traffic.  Savvy motorists\r\nsoon realized that everyone took the route indicated\r\nand clogged the roadway--so the ?best\r\nroute? was probably the worst one.  This raised a\r\ntroubling question: if enough people were alive to\r\nthe real significance of the sign, and so left the ?best\r\nroute? alone, would not the sign become trustworthy\r\nagain?  In that case, people would once again\r\ntake the ?best route,? which would once again call\r\nthe sign into question ... and the situation would\r\nrapidly escalate into a paradox.\r\n\r\n            Where does this leave us?  To postulate that all\r\nlanguage is two-faced runs counter to everyday reality,\r\nwhere people seem perfectly capable of talking\r\nto others without any slippage in meaning.  Yet to\r\nexamine even the simplest utterance is to enter a\r\nlabyrinth of possibility.  In literary criticism, deconstruction\r\nand reader-response models try to deal\r\nwith this problem, deconstructionists pointing out\r\nthe inherent instability of all language, reader-response\r\ncritics insisting that all meaning resides in the\r\naudience's interpretation.  There are also moderates\r\nwho believe, with some common sense, that these\r\nideas are true up to a point.  Perhaps a better way to\r\nput the situation is that language is potentially unstable,\r\nand that the audience is responsible for a large\r\npart of the determinable meaning.\r\n\r\n            Or maybe not.  Cross-talk, after all, depends on\r\nsome idea of ?the real meaning? to achieve its contradictory\r\neffect: it is just that sometimes the meaning\r\ngets lost or misconstrued.  Some years ago in our\r\nfaculty lounge, one of my hazier colleagues got up to\r\nget another cup of coffee.  ?Would you like some??\r\nhe asked the woman sitting next to us.\r\n\r\n            ?No, thanks,? the woman waved aside his offer.\r\n?I don't drink coffee.?\r\n\r\n            ?Really?? he said.  ?What do you do with it??\r\n\r\n            At the time, everyone thought he was kidding.\r\nLooking back on it, I am not so sure.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n               Notice\r\n            \r\n\r\n            We received a manuscript recently from Europe.

Although the book offers a good coverage\r\nof universal abbreviations, acronyms, and what\r\nare these days called ?initialisms? in its 27,000 entries\r\nand ?over? 37,000 definitions and goes into\r\nBritish material quite thoroughly, it is too sparse in\r\nits inclusion of American matter to make it of significant\r\nusefulness to American users, who should\r\ncleave to the De Sola dictionaries of abbreviations.\r\nMoreover, there are omissions that are criticizable\r\neven from the British user's point of view; for instance,\r\nabbreviations of some important American\r\nscholarly societies and periodicals, likely to be\r\nneeded by scholars in the UK, are missing: MLA is in\r\nfor `Modern Language Association,' but not LSA for\r\n`Linguistic Society of America'; PMLA , for `Publication(s)\r\nof the Modern Language Association,' known\r\nthroughout the world, is missing as is AS for `American\r\nSpeech.' \r\n               ACLU `American Civil Liberties Union'\r\nis not in, nor is ACL `Association for Computational\r\nLinguistics.'  Space was found, however, for\r\nU.N.C.L.E . `United Network Command for Law Enforcement'\r\n(followed by ?(television),? as if that explained\r\nthis--what shall I call it?--obsoletism.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               MADD `Mothers Against Drunk Driving' is in\r\n(labeled ?U.S.A.?), but D.W.I . `Driving While Intoxicated'\r\nis not, nor is D.A.M . `Mothers Against Dyslexia.'\r\nWhile the expanded forms are given, generally,\r\nwith no comment beyond a useful contextual\r\nlabel (like ?U.S.A.,? ?television?), some have been\r\ngiven explanatory treatment: P.C . `... Plaid\r\nCymru , Party of Wales, founded 1925 with the aim\r\nof obtaining dominion status for Wales'; P.B . `...\r\nPlymouth Brethren, Christian sect founded in 19th\r\ncent., fundamentalist in doctrine'; T.I.R .

Customs agreement covering\r\n26 countries allowing T.I.R . lorries to avoid\r\ncustoms until reaching final destinations.' ( `Intern .,'\r\nby the way, is not listed in the book as an abbreviation\r\nfor `International,' only int . and intl .)  On the\r\nother hand, some entries that have historical value\r\nare in (like N.R.A., B.O.A.C .) but no indication that\r\nthey are obsolete; W.P.A . has this listing: `Works\r\nProgress/Projects Administration (U.S.A.), begun in\r\n1935 to provide work for needy unemployed': one\r\nmight assume that it is still functioning; at P.W.A .,\r\nhowever, we learn that the `Public Works Administration\r\n(U.S.A.), New Deal Agency [sic], [was] estab.\r\n1933 to create work and promote economic recovery,\r\nabol. 1943.  A `U.S.A.' label was evidently\r\ndeemed unnecessary for D.A.R . `Daughters of the\r\nAmerican Revolution, society of women formed in\r\n1890 for patriotic and charitable purposes.'  Although\r\nthe editor mentions pronounceable acronyms\r\nin his Preface, users would be at a loss to determine\r\nthat UN and R.A.F . are not pronounced but\r\nthat R.A.D.A . (Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts\r\n?RAHdah?), UNICEF, U.N.C.L.E ., and Pan-Am are;\r\nworse, the showing of radar as RADAR (for `radio\r\ndetecting and ranging') and sonar as SONAR (`sound\r\nnavigation and ranging') is in outright error.  The entry\r\nfor S. & M . lists only `Bp. of Sodor and Man.'\r\n\r\n            In short (excuse the pun), for one reason or another\r\nusers in the UK would be better served by a\r\nbetter dictionary of abbreviations than this; US users\r\nshould be alerted to the fact that the text is British,\r\nunedited for American spelling: for `decagramme,\r\ndecalitre, decametre' read `decagram, decaliter, decameter.'\r\nThis is a shame, for publishers in Britain\r\nare frequently heard to comment on the hugeness of\r\nthe US market: in the circumstances, one might expect\r\na publisher as knowledgeable as Penguin to\r\nmake some effort to cater to such a promisingly lucrative\r\nsource of revenue.\r\n\r\n            Laurence Urdang\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            Andrew Gray's remarks on ?nonsense about the\r\nGerman language? [XVIII, 1] reminded me of another\r\nmyth widely held in the English-speaking\r\nworld about German: it tends to have longer words\r\nthan English does.\r\n\r\n            That impression, however, is correct only with\r\nrespect to orthographic words.  Thus, German Impulsquantumzahl\r\nmay seem long to the English-speaker,\r\nbut that is only because German uses\r\nclosed compounds much more than English does.\r\nThe English equivalent of this German word is spin\r\nquantum number .  Were it to be spelled *spinquantumnumber\r\nor were the German word to be spelled\r\n*impuls quantum zahl , people would have other impressions,\r\nyet both words have exactly the same\r\nnumber of syllables (five) and letters (seventeen).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\nToday's Quote: ?The judgment that we can make\r\ngiven our information is that it's not probable that there\r\nwill be an impact on decision-making in Iraq over the\r\ncourse of the next months.--External Affairs Minister Joe\r\nClark.? [From The Province , Vancouver, BC, .  Submitted by ]\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Samuel Johnson in the Medical World\r\n            A frequent ploy in reviewing scholarly books is\r\nfor the reviewer to chide the writer for not having\r\nwritten the book he would like to have read.  What a\r\npleasure it is to report that John Wiltshire of Melbourne's\r\naccount of Samuel Johnson and the medical\r\naspects of his life is just the sort of exposition and\r\nanalysis that this reviewer once considered writing\r\nand that Wiltshire has done it better and on a\r\nbroader canvas.\r\n\r\n            Wiltshire starts with a review of Johnson's own\r\nmedical history: juvenile scrofula, poor vision in one\r\neye, the famous ?tics and gesticulations,? gout,\r\nasthma, a stroke with transient aphasia, and finally\r\n?dropsy? with death due to arteriosclerotic heart\r\ndisease with congestive failure.  Add to this an account\r\nof his recurrent attacks of melancholia, and\r\nthe patient is clearly revealed.  By his own statement\r\nJohnson was ?a dabbler in physick,? and the reader\r\nis given a full account of Johnson's medical readings\r\nand how he assimilated his knowledge for purposes\r\nof self-medication.  Johnson's doctors--Bathurst,\r\nLawrence, Brocklesby, Heberden, and others--are\r\nnot neglected.\r\n\r\n            In further chapters Wiltshire sets forth considerable\r\nuseful information about medicine in 18th\r\ncentury England, its theories, its mode of practice.\r\nJudicious use of primary sources and an aptitude for\r\na telling vignette combine to make these chapters\r\nuseful and intelligible to a reader unfamiliar with the\r\nperiod.  Wiltshire makes full use of Johnson's own\r\nwriting, especially the essays in The Rambler and\r\nThe Idler , to analyze Johnson's frequent, almost habitual\r\nuse of medical ideas as metaphors.\r\n\r\n            A well-shaped chapter deals with the astronomer\r\nin Rasselas as an example of the man of learning\r\nwhose actions are severely limited by a psychiatric\r\nproblem.  Unique in the annals of Johnsoniana is a\r\nfull treatment of Dr. Robert Levet, an unlicensed\r\npractitioner who was a valued member of Johnson's\r\npeculiar household, and Wiltshire's close reading of\r\nJohnson's elegy on Levet is welcome and commendable.\r\nThe monograph concludes with a chapter on\r\ntherapeutic friendship, dealing chiefly with Johnson's\r\nattempts to steer Boswell into a more sensible\r\nway of life and behavior.  These were only transiently\r\neffective because Boswell was less than candid\r\nto his mentor about his compulsive drinking and\r\nwhoring.\r\n\r\n            Some minor cavils: Occasional paragraphs are\r\ndevoted to the exposition and dismissal of various\r\npseudo-psychoanalytic theories about Johnson's personality,\r\na waste of time and space because no Johnson\r\nscholar relies upon them.  Also, the exposition of\r\nmedical ideas about melancholia relies chiefly on the\r\ncontribution of William Battie; the two Scotsmen,\r\nWilliam Cullen and Robert Whytt, deserve equal\r\nbilling for their contributions toward mid-18th century\r\nideas on melancholia.  But on balance Wiltshire's\r\nbook is sound and sensible, a distinguished\r\ncontribution not only to Johnsonia but to the wider\r\nfield of eighteenth-century studies.\r\n\r\n            William B. Ober\r\n\r\n            Tenafly, New Jersey\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Have a Nice Day--No Problem!\r\n            From the standpoint of style, clich?s are anathema:\r\nthey are boring, repetitious, and reflective of\r\npoor writing.  From the standpoint of communication,\r\nhowever, they are extremely important: for\r\none thing, they provide relief from what could otherwise\r\nbe a terrifyingly condensed onslaught of information.\r\nStudy a well-written scholarly article;\r\nnotice how compact it is.  Succinct style presents no\r\nproblem to readers, for they can reread a passage as\r\noften as necessary to assimilate it.  Those who attend\r\nacademic conferences soon come to dread the\r\nspeaker who reads aloud a paper meant to be read in\r\na journal: it is almost impossible to assimilate its information\r\nbecause none of the normal communicative\r\ndevices used in viva voce communication are\r\npresent--repetition being among them.  Then, too,\r\nthe speaker who maintains eye contact with members\r\nof his audience can readily detect lack of understanding\r\nor confusion (the ?knitted-brow signal?)\r\nand, if a good speaker, can take an idea and phrase it\r\nin another way to make it more readily understandable.\r\nClich?s are the background noise of speech; attention\r\nspans being as brief as they are and the ability\r\nto sustain a prolonged period of concentration\r\ndiffering considerably among individuals (even if\r\none assumes that the subject under discussion is of\r\nsome interest to the listener), the insertion in speech\r\nof clich?s acts to give the overworked cells a rest,\r\nhowever momentary, from overdosing on information.\r\n\r\n            Clich?s in writing are another matter; depending\r\non the style striven for, they might conceivably\r\nserve a function; as with everything else, overdoing\r\nthem can create a long-winded, boring experience.\r\n\r\n            It is not easy to distinguish between clich?s and\r\nwhat linguists call collocations--that is, collections\r\nof words that, while not unanalyzable idioms per se\r\n(like red herring, tall order , or take off in the sense of\r\n`satirize'), nonetheless seem to fall together with\r\ngreat frequency.  Serve a function is such a collocation\r\nas are (from the preceding paragraph) from the\r\nstandpoint of, provide relief, present a [or no ] problem,\r\nas often [or any adjective/adverb] as , noun\r\nphrases like eye contact, lack of understanding, member\r\nof his [or any pronoun, name, or article] audience,\r\nbackground noise , and attention span .  Those\r\nwho have had experience with a person learning\r\nEnglish as a foreign language are aware that a breakthrough\r\nseems to come as soon as the person starts\r\nusing clich?s and colloquial or slang expressions appropriately,\r\neven though the speaker's pronunciation\r\nmay still be far from a native speaker's.  It would\r\nseem that good control over clich?s, especially, is\r\ncoordinate with a speaker's grasp of the idiom (in\r\nthe sense of `spirit') of the language.\r\n\r\n            A dictionary of clich?s is an entirely different\r\nmatter.  I venture to say that there is hardly anything\r\nmore soporific than being given the meanings of expressions\r\nthat every native speaker knows quite intimately,\r\nfrom do an about face to yours truly (in this\r\nbook).  One could not compile such a book without\r\ngiving the meanings, but the interesting and useful\r\nmaterial here for the native speaker is what Christine\r\nAmmer has to say about their past and provenance.\r\nThus, we learn that on the razor's edge occurs\r\nin Homer and that mad as a hatter , which\r\nantedates Alice's teaparty, ?is thought to come from\r\nthe fact that the chemicals used in making felt hats\r\ncould produce the symptoms of St. Vitus' dance or\r\nother nervous tremors.?  As one might expect, many\r\nclich?s are simply metaphors, some of which are\r\ntransparent to us, others needing explanation.  Thus,\r\nplay ball with seems obvious; but mad as a hatter ,\r\nthough properly a simile, needs an explanation; play\r\npossum is meaningful only to those who have been\r\ntold what it means or have had direct experience\r\nwith the behavior of opossums.  There are quite a lot\r\nof opossums where I live (not, I hasten to say, of the\r\npossum type meriting the affectionate attention of\r\nDame Edna Everage), and one sees them most often\r\nafter they have been killed on the road by a car.  A\r\ncontemporary might thus be inclined to imbue them\r\nwith attributes that would give play possum a mysterious\r\nimport.  One might well wonder why some\r\nclich?s have survived at all, considering their meaninglessness.\r\nThe etymological game being what it\r\nis--( requiescat in ) pace John Ciardi--I fully expect\r\nsomeone to come up with an origin for cute as a\r\nbutton that identifies it with the six adorable daughters\r\nof some 17th-century Londoner named Button\r\nor, just to make it more complicated, a corruption of\r\nthe expression *acute as a bouton in which bouton\r\nmeans `stud with a sharp point'--in other words,\r\noriginally equivalent to sharp as a tack .\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Have a Nice Day contains useful information\r\nabout some 3000 such expressions, and we must be\r\ngrateful to Ms. Ammer for having come to grips\r\nwith a very difficult area of language.  My only criticism\r\nis that she often states that a given expression\r\n?first appeared? in a certain work, giving the citation.\r\nI cannot see how she can know that the expression\r\nwas not already a clich? at the time of its appearance\r\nin print.  In the case of have a good day ,\r\nwhich riles many people, I submit that it is a revival,\r\nfor its equivalent must have been in the language\r\nmany years ago in order to have given rise to the\r\nshortened form (about which no one seems to get\r\nupset), Good day .  On which note I bid you all a good\r\nday.\r\n\r\n            Laurence Urdang\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Wordspinner\r\n            Sterling Eisiminger, whose name may be familiar\r\nto VERBATIM readers as a contributor, has compiled\r\nseveral hundred quizzes that will undoubtedly\r\nboggle the minds of some.  It has always seemed to\r\nme that we view the answering of questions of fact\r\n(like what a word means or what is its etymology) as\r\neither ?easy? or ?difficult? depending on whether\r\nwe know the answer or not.  In other words, if one\r\ndoes not know the date of the Flushing Remonstrance\r\nno amount of thinking, soul-searching, calculation,\r\nor any other mental activity is going to yield\r\nthe correct response to the question, ?What was the\r\ndate of the Flushing Remonstrance??; on the other\r\nhand, if you know that the date was 1657, one cannot\r\nsay that the answer was ?easy? or ?difficult?: it\r\nis like asking a person his name.  Some people have\r\nbetter memories than others, and we can admire\r\nthose who, despite the extraordinary pressure of being\r\nunder the klieg lights in a TV studio before an\r\naudience, are able to dredge up obscure information\r\nin response to quizmasters' questions.  But the accession\r\nof factual information from the recesses of\r\nthe memory is not the same as answering questions\r\nthat require rapid mental calculation or analysis.  A\r\nvery large percentage of quiz shows consist of testing\r\nthe participants' abilities to recognize familiar\r\nthings, like identifying the pattern K--K --- ---K-- as\r\nkick the bucket before too many letters have been\r\nexposed.  There are several TV quiz programs in the\r\nUK and in the US in which the winners are those\r\nwho are quickest at recognizing clich?s, like come\r\nhell or high water , something that the rest of us\r\nspend a lot of time avoiding (though we can scarcely\r\nhelp knowing them).  Yet, there are some who, believe\r\nit or not, do not possess even minimal control\r\nover this linguistic dross: within the past few weeks I\r\nheard one TV newscaster say ?wheres and whyfors?\r\nand another refer to ?a Herculanean task? (presumably\r\nthe labor involved in giving birth to a volcano).\r\n[See, elsewhere in this issue, the review of Have a\r\nNice Day--No Problem! ]\r\n\r\n            That having been said (to coin a clich?), quizzes\r\nare for some people an attractive way to learn things\r\nwhile playing a sort of game, testing either themselves\r\nor others.  In Wordspinner , some of the quizzes\r\nare mere vocabulary tests, though couched in\r\nlight-hearted utterances; for example, at Graffiti II\r\nthe reader is asked to define the underscored words\r\nin sentences like ?Clark Kent was a transvestite?\r\nand ?Vasectomy means never having to say you're\r\nsorry,? though one could think of a lot of regrettable\r\nactions for which vasectomy would be a feeble excuse.\r\nOther quizzes ?test? the knowledge of the\r\nreader's knowledge of gay, black, or carnival slang,\r\nof the origins of certain words ( topaz matches up\r\nwith ?Greek for `conjecture' because they could\r\nonly guess where it came from?), some of tautological\r\nclich?s (like beck and --), others of nautical jargon,\r\neuphemisms, numerical allusions, Yankee dialect,\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\n            The range of language is, of course, vast, and\r\none should not treat with contempt those parts of\r\nthe book that deal with matters considered ?common\r\nknowledge?: those parts that seem recondite to\r\none are common knowledge to another.  The challenge\r\nis slightly mitigated in many instances by offering\r\na listing of multiple choices from among\r\nwhich one selects the answer.  If one needs a more\r\ndifficult challenge, the choices can be covered by\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\n            There is no index, hence no way of retrieving\r\ninformation once encountered (except by trying to\r\nrecall the ?name of the game?).  But that is not critical,\r\nfor this is not a reference book.  The 400-odd\r\nquizzes could serve well as a source for teachers\r\nwho want to test their students' knowledge of different\r\naspects of language.  And while much of the material\r\nmight seem simple to sophisticated readers of\r\nVERBATIM, its editor learned from Wordspinner that\r\na marriage between a brother and the childless\r\nwidow of the groom's brother is called a leviratic\r\nmarriage and that cut the green calabash is Gullah\r\nfor `exaggerate.'

Submitted by \r\n]\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Lost Charisma\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            What ideas would you expect to find expressed\r\nin a book by a liberal economist?  Can a holistic\r\napproach to arthritis ignore important aspects\r\nof the disease?  Should your teenager's interest in a\r\nmovement with a charismatic leader alarm you?\r\n\r\n            In everyday speech, the vocabulary of social science\r\nand philosophy can be misleading.  Just as\r\nbadly worn coins convey little information to the numismatist,\r\ntheir once-clear markings having faded\r\nwith countless transactions, so some words convey\r\nlittle information because their meanings have been\r\nobscured by repeated and varied usage.  Charisma is\r\na good example.  Writers use the word when it does\r\nnot apply and do not use it in those rare instances\r\nwhen it does.  Charisma's unfortunate fate is the subject\r\nof this essay.\r\n\r\n            Today, it seems that charismatic figures are everywhere.\r\nMovie stars, athletes, politicians--any-one\r\nwho catches the public eye--may enjoy the designer\r\nlabel.  It is applied not only to individuals, but\r\nalso, for example, to Richard Pryor's humor, Gershwin's\r\nmusic, and Lassie.  Are the Ninja Turtles next?\r\nCharisma now means little more than dazzle , says\r\nAllan Bloom, and he is correct.  But, what did the\r\nword once mean?  And what difficulties do its current\r\nusage pose?\r\n\r\n            Two tributaries brought charisma into the English\r\nlanguage, one theological, one sociological.  The\r\nword comes from the Greek, more precisely, the\r\nGreek of the New Testament.  Theologically, the Oxford\r\nEnglish Dictionary tells us, it is a ?free gift or\r\nfavor specifically vouchsafed by God, a grace, a talent.?\r\nIn the Bible, it appears only in the Letters of\r\nPaul and occupies a particularly important place in\r\nI Corinthians.  There, Paul discusses a number of\r\nspiritual gifts or charismata , including the gifts of\r\nmiracles, healing, and speaking in tongues (divinely\r\ninspired but unintelligible speech).  During the\r\nChurch's early years, these gifts must have captured\r\nthe attention and imagination of many, for Paul\r\nwrites to remind Christians that all charismata have\r\na common divine source and that none is as important\r\nas love.\r\n\r\n            Writers using charisma or charismatic in this or\r\nrelated theological senses are not likely to err.\r\nThose using the term in its sociological sense, however,\r\noften go astray.  This second meaning of the\r\nterm entered English through, translations of the\r\nworks of the eminent German sociologist, Max Weber.\r\nWriting in the early twentieth century, Weber\r\nused the term in his sociology of religion and sociology\r\nof authority:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term ?charisma? will be applied to a certain\r\nquality of an individual personality by virtue of\r\nwhich he is considered extraordinary and treated\r\nas endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at\r\nleast specifically exceptional powers or qualities.\r\nThese are such as are not accessible to the ordinary\r\nperson, but are regarded as of divine origin\r\nor as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual\r\nconcerned is treated as a ?leader.?\r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Charisma, Weber argued, provided the basis for an\r\nintensely personal form of authority, dramatically\r\ndifferent from authority based both on the impersonal\r\nrule of law (the modern type) and on the sanctity\r\nof tradition (the oldest type).  Historically rare,\r\ncharismatic figures, like Jesus or Mohammed,\r\nfounded new faiths or, like Napoleon, won the unswerving\r\nallegiance of soldiers and citizens through\r\nmilitary victory.\r\n\r\n            Today's commentators make two errors when\r\nthey use charismatic .  First, they apply the term to\r\ninappropriate figures.  Even though the word's sociological\r\nmeaning has changed ( charisma is ?the\r\ncapacity to inspire devotion and enthusiasm,? according\r\nto the latest OED ), someone like Henry Kissinger\r\ncannot merit the label.  Calling such public\r\nfigures charismatic devalues the word and strips it of\r\nmeaning (meaninglessness certainly triumphs when\r\nwriters see charisma in humor or music).\r\n\r\n            But users of the word make a second, more serious,\r\nerror when they apply the term to virtuous figures\r\nonly, as occurs often.  An article in the February\r\n1982 Good Housekeeping (?Charisma: Who Has It!\r\nHow They Got It!  How You Can Get It Too!?) mentions\r\nmore than fifteen charismatic figures, from Eleanor\r\nRoosevelt to Lena Horne, all admirable individuals.\r\nSimilarly, Ronald Riggio begins a recent\r\nbook on charisma by enumerating eleven charismatic\r\npersons, all praiseworthy.  After one hundred\r\nand twenty-five pages, we finally discover some demons.\r\nAs a corrective, I suggest that someone begin\r\na discussion of charisma like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you like to develop your charisma?  Would\r\nyou like to sway others?  Would you like the\r\npower to drive nine hundred people to collective\r\nsuicide like Jim Jones?  Inspire others to murder\r\nlike Charles Manson?  Or, why not really go for\r\nit, and annihilate millions of innocents?  Hitler\r\ndid it; you can too.\r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Hitler, Charles Manson, Jim Jones--they represent\r\ncharisma's other side, one our commentators invariably\r\nignore.  When was the last time you heard a\r\nrepulsive figure described as charismatic?  In rare\r\ninstances, an individual not universally admired, like\r\nJesse Jackson, earns the label, but heinous figures\r\nare never ?charismatic.?  Weber, it is worth noting,\r\nhad stressed the neutrality of the term:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Our] sociological analysis will treat [demagogues\r\nand madmen] on the same level as it does the\r\ncharisma of men who are the ?greatest? heroes,\r\nprophets, and saviors according to conventional\r\njudgments.\r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Weber wanted to compare aspects of charismatic authority\r\nwith aspects of his other two types of authority.\r\nHe did not distinguish between villainous charismatic\r\nfigures and virtuous ones because such\r\ndistinctions, he felt, would muddy sociological comparisons.\r\nWeber obviously knew the term could apply\r\nto both.  Modern commentators, however, will\r\nnot attribute charisma to those they do not like.\r\nConsider the Ayatollah Khomeini.  No political figure\r\nin the last two decades was more charismatic\r\nthan he.  His authority derived from intensely personal\r\nqualities; he ruled without the institutional\r\nsupports we associate with national leadership; he\r\ninspired his followers and revolutionized his country.\r\nBut to many commentators, Khomeini was a fanatic .\r\nCharismatic is thus used as selectively as neurotic .\r\nNeurotics are those whose behavior we find\r\nodd.  If we like them, however, we speak of their\r\nidiosyncracies .\r\n\r\n            When we do not apply the term charismatic to\r\nfigures like Khomeini, we trivialize them and we\r\ntrivialize their followers.  We label Iranian fundamentalists\r\nirrational or unstable because they are inspired\r\nby someone we do not like.  But charisma is\r\nall about irrationality, and we have little reason to\r\nbelieve that the followers of Khomeini were less rational\r\nthan the followers of, say, Jesus.  In fact, as\r\nindicated above, the irrationality of the more spectacular\r\ncharismata drew concerned comment from\r\nSaint Paul in I Corinthians.  The rich etymology of\r\ncharisma teaches us that great villains and great heroes\r\ncan have strangely similar effects on their followers.\r\nCharisma should thus be used evenhandedly\r\nas well as selectively.  Like other words from the lexicon\r\nof social science and philosophy ( holistic, elitist,\r\nliberal, dialectic ), it confuses rather than illuminates\r\nif used indiscriminately.  The season's hottest passwords\r\nmust not triumph over clear communication.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Unraveling the American Place-Name Cover\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n               There is no part of the world where nomenclature\r\nis so rich, poetical, humorous and picturesque\r\nas the United States of America.\r\nRobert Louis Stevenson, Across the Plains (1892)\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The fascination of American place names--their\r\nstyle and flair and what they reveal about the\r\nland and its inhabitants--has captivated writers,\r\nscholars, and other observers for more than 150\r\nyears.  The evaluation of Stevenson, from a collection\r\nof essays on his travels across America, is not\r\nunusual.  Stevenson, a native Scot, had traveled\r\nwidely through Europe, the U.S., and the South\r\nSeas, so he speaks with some experience and perspective.\r\nOther notables who have praised American\r\nplace names include Washington Irving (in an\r\nessay written in 1839), Walt Whitman, and Stephen\r\nVincent Ben?t.  The qualities most frequently commented\r\non, perhaps, are originality, uniqueness, and\r\nsound.  Consider the following categories of American\r\nplace names, selected from the Omni Gazetteer\r\nof the United States of America:\r\n\r\n               \r\nBizarre\r\n\r\nCheesequake, New Jersey\r\nJot 'Em Down, Texas\r\nKnockemstiff, Ohio\r\nAttaway, South Carolina\r\nUneedus, Louisiana\r\nUnthanks, Virginia\r\nToad Suck, Arkansas\r\nHump Tulips, Washington\r\nEek, Alaska\r\nIdiotville, Oregon\r\nWho'd A Thought It, Alabama\r\nZzyzx, California\r\n\r\nIndecorous\r\nSugartit and Beaverlick, Kentucky\r\nCrapo, Maryland\r\nSuperior Bottom, West Virginia\r\nSuck Lick Run (stream in West Virginia)\r\nBlue Ball (Arkansas and Ohio)\r\nPee Pee, Ohio\r\nShittim Gulch, Washington\r\n\r\nUnimaginative\r\n141 U.S. municipalities are named Fairview\r\n(43 different states); there are 47 Jackson Townships\r\nin Indiana alone; 1,365 streams are named\r\nMill Creek.\r\n\r\nFanciful\r\nZook Spur, Iowa\r\nTyewhoppety, Oklahoma\r\nZu Zu, Tennessee\r\nTizzle Flats, Virginia\r\nUtsaladdy, Washington\r\n\r\nSic!

In addition, significant\r\ncontributions have come from many Indian languages\r\nand dialects, as well as Spanish, French, and\r\nBritish sources.\r\n\r\n            It was in the 1920s that serious scholarship on\r\nAmerican place names, characterized (unlike most\r\nearlier work) by thoroughness, objectivity, and linguistic\r\ntraining, began to be published on a regular\r\nbasis.  Among the scholarly pioneers was George R.\r\nStewart, whose considered reflections are collected\r\nin standard works entitled Names on the Land (1945,\r\nrevised 1958 and 1967) and American Place-Names\r\n(1970).  Prof. Allen Walker Read, whose distinguished\r\ncareer now spans seven decades, contributed\r\nsolid yet always thoroughly enjoyable papers,\r\nand in addition has given us the handy phrase\r\n?place-name cover? to describe how place names\r\nindeed blanket the country with richness, color, and\r\ntexture.  Other notables in this necessarily brief catalogue\r\nof American toponymists include Henry Gannett,\r\nworking around the turn of the century, who\r\ncompiled several state gazetteers and a still influential\r\nstudy on the origin of U.S. place names; H. L.\r\nMencken, with several seminal chapters in his American\r\nLanguage (1936); and Kelsie Harder, whose Illustrated\r\nDictionary of Place Names: United States\r\nand Canada (1976) remains the most reliable resource\r\nfor place-name origins.  A full record of work\r\nin this field can be found in bibliographies compiled\r\nsince 1948 under the names Sealock, Seely, and\r\nPowell (the latest edition being Bibliography of\r\nPlace-Name Literature: United States and Canada,\r\nThird Edition , 1982), supplemented periodically in\r\nthe pages of Names , the quarterly journal of the\r\nAmerican Name Society.\r\n\r\n            Toponymy is remarkable not only for the hundreds\r\nof talented contributors who have expanded\r\nthe scholarship in recent decades, but also because\r\nit is not a formal academic discipline, at least not in\r\nthe United States.  There are no departments of toponymy,\r\nor even of onomastics that I know of, and no\r\ndegrees are awarded in these fields.  (Whether this is\r\nalso true of other countries I cannot say.  I have read\r\nthat toponymy, gazetteers, and place-name surveys\r\nreceive more formal attention in the U.K. and Europe.)\r\nAmerican toponymy is carried on by people\r\nof all academic disciplines, and from many walks of\r\nlife.  With academia's standard rewards of promotion\r\nand tenure not as readily accruing in this work, the\r\nstudy of American place names is by and large in\r\nthe hands of true lovers of the subject (amateurs in\r\nthe etymological sense, and dilettantes).  What they\r\nsay and write I have found to be characteristically\r\nstimulating and rewarding, not plagued by the turgidity\r\nthat so often seems to be the norm in scholarly\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n            Place names became an official concern of the\r\nU.S. government in 1890.  Confusion had reigned\r\nover mining claims, land surveys, assignment of\r\npost-office names, and exploration reports, and this\r\ncreated havoc and needless expense in bureaucracy,\r\nparticularly in the government mapping agencies\r\nsuch as the U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], the\r\nArmy Corps of Engineers, and various other\r\nbranches of the departments of Agriculture, Commerce,\r\nand Interior.  In a move that, from a lexicographic\r\nstandpoint, is decidedly un-American, the\r\ngovernment set up an official board to rule on and\r\nstandardize the use of place names, both domestic\r\nand foreign.  The United States Board on Geographic\r\nNames was established by an executive order\r\nof President Benjamin Harrison in September\r\n1890, and has been active ever since, publishing its\r\ndecisions and issuing official gazetteers.  This may be\r\nthe only example in which an aspect of the linguistic\r\npractice of Americans has been regulated by government\r\nfiat.\r\n\r\n            On the other hand, it is largely because of this\r\nunusual intrusion of government that American toponymy\r\nhas flourished as a field of study.  The U.S.\r\nBoard on Geographic Names has compiled and\r\nmaintains a massive national database, the Geographic\r\nNames Information System [GNIS].  This\r\ncomputer file lists more than one million place\r\nnames of all kinds (plus hundreds of thousands of\r\nvariant forms): cities and towns, lakes and rivers,\r\nmountains and valleys, even facilities such as\r\nschools, parks, and cemeteries.  The names themselves,\r\nalong with precise locational data and identification\r\nby type, have been painstakingly keyboarded\r\ninto machine-readable form from the most\r\ndetailed USGS topographic maps, the so-called 7.5-minute\r\nseries.  Drawn to a scale of 1:24,000, each\r\n7.5-minute map sheet or quadrangle covers an area\r\nof 8.6 miles north-to-south by about 7 miles east-to-west\r\n(the east-to-west distance varies depending on\r\nlocation, since meridians of longitude radiate out\r\nfrom the poles and are farther apart nearer the equator).\r\nAt this scale more than 50,000 map sheets are\r\nrequired to completely cover the 48 contiguous\r\nstates.  Since it was intended to establish a standard,\r\nthe GNIS is very regular in format and is compiled\r\nand maintained according to carefully prepared procedures.\r\nThis daunting task is overseen by the\r\nUSGS, specifically the Branch of Domestic Names,\r\nnow under the direction of Roger Payne.  Less comprehensive\r\ngovernment files are also maintained by\r\nthe Bureau of the Census (listing about 60,000 populated\r\nplaces), and by the National Institute of Standards\r\nand Technology, formerly the Bureau of Standards\r\n(a compilation, complete with numerical\r\ncoding, of some 190,000 populated places, locales,\r\nand neighborhoods of all sizes).\r\n\r\n            The work is by no means at an end.  Experts,\r\nincluding Mr. Payne, have estimated that there are\r\nmore than 3,500,000 current place names in the\r\nU.S. Consider this figure in light of the fact that the\r\nlargest English dictionary--now out of print--had\r\n600,000 or so entries, including many obsolete\r\nforms.  The highest estimates of the size of the English\r\nlexicon number far less than the number of place\r\nnames in the U.S. alone.  Were it possible to record\r\nand identify all of the current place names (the Place\r\nName Survey of the United States, under the direction\r\nof the American Name Society, is attempting\r\njust this), still remaining would be hundreds of thousands\r\nof now inactive names, which are of no less\r\nimportance to historians, genealogists, and the like.\r\nFull coverage would also require accurate\r\npronunciations for each name, with sensitivity to local\r\npreferences (e.g., MAD-rid, New York, for Madrid ,\r\nBER-lin, Connecticut, for Berlin , and PEER,\r\nSouth Dakota, for Pierre ).  It is perhaps understandable\r\nthat those who undertake the creation of a complete\r\nrecord of American toponymy have chosen to\r\ndeal with the estimated 3,000,000 named streets\r\nand highways across the land as a separate project.\r\n\r\n            Taken in this context, the recent publication of\r\nthe Omni Gazetteer of the United States of America ,\r\ndespite its 1,500,000 entries, may properly be seen\r\nas only a first step, albeit an ambitious one.  The editors\r\nof the book identified and acquired several government\r\ndatabases of place names, including, of\r\ncourse, the GNIS mentioned above.  Owing to the\r\nmarvels of computer technology, coupled with the\r\nforesight of the government programmers who set\r\nup the source databases and the expertise of present-day\r\nprogrammers who devised means of accurately\r\nconsolidating several different sources, an\r\nenormous amount of data (140,520,000 characters\r\nof text) was integrated, sorted, and typeset in about\r\nsix months.  Automated as well as traditional checking\r\nand proofreading occupied the staff for the better\r\npart of a year.  The final product is contained in\r\n11 volumes, on more than 9,000 9-by-12-inch, 2-column\r\npages.  The set includes nine regional\r\nvolumes, each listing the place names of the states or\r\nterritories in a region individually.  A one-volume\r\nNational Index lists all 1,500,000 entries in a single\r\nA-to-Z sequence.  The Appendices volume contains\r\nseven national lists of places such as airports, Indian\r\nreservations, and historic places.  The Omni Gazetteer\r\nis a national gazetteer of the United States that\r\nis as comprehensive as possible.  It is published both\r\nas bound books and on CD-ROM.  Prior to its publication,\r\nsuch place-name information was only available\r\nin disparate sources, and often only on magnetic\r\ntape or in the form of computer printouts.\r\n\r\n            Having had the opportunity to sift through so\r\nmany American place names in a relatively short\r\nspan, those of us who edited the Omni Gazetteer\r\nwere particularly struck by the great diversity in\r\nAmerican naming practices, and what it suggests\r\nabout the various eras and cultures that were a part\r\nof the settlement of the country.  In New England,\r\nfor example, towns are the primary division of government\r\nbelow the state level.  Most of the land area\r\nin the six New England states is within town boundaries,\r\nand is primarily administered by the town governments.\r\nNew Englanders, even if they do not live\r\nin an urban area, can almost always tell you the\r\nname of the town that they live in.  As the name New\r\nEngland might suggest, many of these town names\r\nwere transplanted from the British Isles.  Bristol,\r\nCambridge, Chester, Durham, Essex, Hartford, Lincoln,\r\nLitchfield, Manchester, Marlboro(ugh), Milford,\r\nOxford, Salisbury, Winchester, Windsor, and\r\nWoodstock are town names that occur in three or\r\nmore New England states.  Apart from these, names\r\nof Indian origin (Kennebunkport, Naugatuck, Scituate),\r\nhonorifics (Amherst, Franklin), and biblical\r\nnames (Canaan, Rehoboth, Hebron) account for\r\nmuch of the rest.  As one looks elsewhere in the\r\nU.S., the preponderance of British borrowings diminishes,\r\nand the purely American inventions increase\r\nin proportion, as do Indian, Spanish, and\r\nFrench-based names.  The well-documented Indian\r\ninfluence is widespread.  Spanish names are particularly\r\ncommon in the areas of long-lasting Spanish colonial\r\ninfluence, especially California and the Southwest.\r\nFrench names, of course, are common in the\r\nUpper Midwest (where French explorers and missionaries,\r\nand French-speaking trappers, left their\r\nmark), in states bordering Quebec, and in Louisiana.\r\n\r\n            The differing forms of administrative divisions\r\nin the states is also revealed in naming practices.  For\r\nexample, county government, significant in most of\r\nthe U.S., is relatively unimportant in New England.\r\nIn fact, Connecticut and Rhode Island have abolished\r\ncounty government altogether, and in those\r\nstates the former county boundaries merely furnish\r\na convenient way in which people can refer to a regional\r\ngroup of towns.  But as one travels west and\r\nsouth in the U.S., counties are politically vital, and\r\ntowns, in the New England sense, at least, almost\r\nnonexistent.  (New England-style ?towns? are found\r\nto some extent in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nand Wisconsin.)  In many rural areas west of the\r\nMississippi, where counties can be as big as New\r\nEngland states and cities are few and far between,\r\npeople do not associate closely with a city, town,\r\nvillage, or any other such entity below the county\r\nlevel.  Mail, of course, comes to a post office that\r\nhandles rural route delivery, but those who receive\r\nsuch mail may not live in the place with the post\r\noffice, and hence do not immediately associate with\r\nit.  When asked where they live, such folks are more\r\nlikely to say their county, then give a reference\r\npoint and directions: ?Our place is ten miles north\r\nof Baxter, off Highway 102, then left two miles on\r\nRoute 47.?  So despite more than 200,000 populated\r\nplace names recorded in the Omni Gazetteer , there\r\nare still many areas of the country where the place-name\r\ncover is thin.  Local informants, we hope, will\r\nallow us to correct and expand on the entries compiled\r\nso far.\r\n\r\n            Most of the examples above have been populated\r\nplaces, as these names tend to be more familiar\r\nto a broader audience.  So we have not examined the\r\nbulk of the place-name cover, which is in the form of\r\nnames for natural features.  But perhaps VERBATIM\r\nreaders can more readily allow the author the convenience\r\nof such specialization when they consider\r\nthe issue from the viewpoint of a toponymist.  As\r\nthose who work in the field all too soon come to\r\nrealize, most of the names have yet to be recorded,\r\nmuch less described; the greater burden lies ahead.\r\nWith time and additional resources we might begin\r\nto see the fight at the end of the tunnel, perhaps in\r\nten to fifteen years.  All the while, of course, just as\r\nwith all aspects of language, new names are coming\r\ninto being, others passing out of use, each reflecting\r\na bit of history or culture.  Taken together, American\r\nplace names are a unique primary source, a record\r\nof our cultural memory.  The publication of that part\r\nof the record we do have, however imperfect, will\r\nstill, we hope, give new impetus to this enlightening,\r\noften fascinating study by providing a foundation on\r\nwhich to build.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            The Omni Gazetteer is available in two editions, as\r\neleven bound volumes and on CD-ROM.  The first nine\r\nvolumes cover New England, Northeastern States, Southeast,\r\nSouth Central States, Southwestern States, Great Lakes\r\nStates, Plains States, Mountain States , and Pacific ; the additional\r\ntwo volumes index all 1.5 million entries alphabetically\r\nand offer appendices with additional indexes.  The\r\nprice of each volume is $ 250; the complete (11-volume)\r\nset costs $ 2000.  Floppy disks for each state are available\r\nfor $ 125.

Those who used the term mentioned it so\r\ncavalierly--to mean a `sweet or dessert,' even the\r\nshop that sold it--that I supposed I'd have no difficulty\r\nlooking it up.\r\n\r\n            Referring to dictionaries old and new, I found\r\ngedunk listed only in Webster 3 , with that frustrating\r\nlabel ?origin unknown.?  I examined the Oxford\r\nEnglish Dictionary (1977) and the Oxford Universal\r\nDictionary (1955) and found no listing in either.\r\nNeither was the term cited in any of the many references\r\nI examined, until I saw Dennis Anderson's\r\n?The Book of Slang,? Jonathan David Publishers,\r\nInc., Middle Village, NY, 1975.  There the definition\r\nwas a ?sweet treat or dessert,? no derivation.  Webster\r\ngives ?something sold at a soda fountain or\r\nsnack bar.?  After querying others, I learned only\r\nthat the word was used in the U. S. Navy during the\r\n1950s.\r\n\r\n            I'm stuck on the derivation, finding no hints at\r\nall.  Because the word sounds to me German or Yiddish\r\nor Dutch, I tried dank `thanks' or gedank\r\n`thought, idea' but could not bridge the gulf between\r\ndefinitions.\r\n\r\n            I guess the use is American, not used perhaps\r\nuntil the fifties.  Do VERBATIM readers know?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            As a new subscriber to VERBATIM I was sorry to\r\nmiss the learned disquisitions on the grammatical\r\nuse of the f -word.  The apotheosis was reached,\r\nwithout doubt, in the western desert when a disconsolate\r\nsquaddie who was peering through the mechanical\r\nentrails of his tank was asked by his oppo\r\nwhat was ?up.? ?I dunno,? he replied, ?I think the\r\nf...g f...r's finally f...gwell f...d.?\r\n\r\n            In the matter of the adoption of English in preference\r\nto German as the official American language\r\n[XVII,3], according to George Berlitz's book, Native\r\nTongues (Granada, 1983), Hebrew and French as\r\nwell as German were suggested, with German favored\r\nfor several reasons:\r\n\r\n            There were many German-speaking Americans\r\nin Pennsylvania and other states; Dutch settlers in\r\nNew York and elsewhere could learn to use German\r\neasily; German would be easy for other colonials to\r\nlearn, since it was basically similar to English; the\r\nHessians, German troop levies ?rented? by the British,\r\nwere deserting to the Americans and many\r\nwished to remain in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            There is support, in both the OED 2nd Supplement\r\nand the Dictionary of American Slang , by Wentworth\r\nand Flexner, for Tony Thorne's definition, in\r\nthe Bloomsbury Dictionary of Contemporary Slang\r\n[XVII, 3], of `callow youth' for gunsel .  That appears\r\nto be the primary meaning of the word, whose suggested\r\ndefinition is from Yiddish genzel, gantzel and/\r\nor German G?nslein, G?nzel `gosling, young goose.'\r\nIn the underworld, apparently, it came to be applied,\r\ncontemptuously, to a whole range of people,\r\nmostly young: apprentice hobo, inexpert hoodlum,\r\npunk, nance, sneak, informer, and so on.  In The Maltese\r\nFalcon , the Bogart character was probably using\r\nit as a general term of disparagement.\r\n\r\n            Ellery Queen, in In the Queen's Parlour (1957),\r\nhas a note on Dashiell Hammett's use of the word.\r\nHammett had a taste for trying to slip censorable\r\nwords past cautious editors, and he succeeded with\r\ngunsel , which sounds innocent enough to anyone\r\nwho never heard it before.  When the book was\r\ncoming out in Black Mask , in 1929, the editor presumably\r\ntook gunsel to be a synonym of gunman , and\r\nin that sense it was very widely adopted by Hammett's\r\nimitators, by the general public, and even, it\r\nseems, by the underworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            Regarding J. B. Lawrence's comments on my\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHIA [XVII, 4], I am obliged to set the\r\nrecord straight.  I asked one hundred friends, students,\r\nand fellow linguists about the grammaticality\r\nof eclectic bounty .  Not one felt that The New York\r\nTimes erred in its usage.  Mr. Lawrence is a prescriptivist\r\nand we linguists are descriptivist in orientation.\r\n\r\n            Turning to Mr. Lawrence's remark that featherweight\r\nshould precede lightweight , my listing them\r\nin the reverse order was done randomly and in no\r\nway implied how much a boxer or wrestler weighed.\r\nHe, unfortunately, jumped to the wrong conclusion.\r\nMy list was also merely indicative of the terms currently\r\nemployed (five of them), and Bernstein's Reverse\r\nDictionary mentions the other major divisions\r\nas well.  I could have listed the other terms too, but\r\nchose not to do so.\r\n\r\n            Finally, concerning the etymology of savvy , Mr.\r\nLawrence should not believe everything he reads in\r\nsources such as Mencken's American Language .  In\r\nfact, I checked in another dozen English dictionaries,\r\nand they all state that savvy comes from Spanish\r\nsabe .  These dictionaries are simply wrong on this\r\npoint (as they are, I might add, on many other etymologies).\r\nNo less an authority than Professor Robert\r\nA. Hall, Jr., of Cornell University, one of the\r\nworld's leading figures in Romance linguistics and\r\nhistorical linguistics, the author of dozens of scholarly\r\nbooks and hundreds of scholarly articles, states\r\nthat it derives ultimately from Cantonese Pidgin\r\nPortuguese through Chinese Pidgin English ( Pidgin\r\nand Creole Languages , Cornell University Press,\r\n1966, p. 6).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            I want to add my bit to the letters of Zellig Bach\r\nand Sol Steinmetz in respect to the mangled forms in\r\nYiddish issued by the U.S. Census authorities.\r\nThough I'm not a U.S. citizen I feel personally offended\r\nthat they treated the language in such a cavalier\r\nway.  The form (which I obtained) was downright\r\ngibberish, corresponding to no idiom on earth.\r\nIn spelling, grammar, and plain meaning it made no\r\nsense whatsoever.  Surely they could have consulted\r\nwith YIVO, whose name must have penetrated even\r\ndarkest Washington.\r\n\r\n            I read Bill Bryson's article ?English Know-How,\r\nNo Problem? with much interest and amusement.\r\nHowever, some of the words he indicates as listed by\r\nThe Economist in 1986 are not by origin English but\r\nFrench ( hotel, cigarette ) or international ( telephone ).\r\nTrue, they may owe their worldwide currency and\r\nubiquity to the fact that they were part of the body\r\nof English word export, but are they really words\r\nthat originated in English or are they loanwords in\r\nEnglish?\r\n\r\n            In your OBITER DICTA you translate hocking a\r\ntchainik as `gossiping.'  Isn't it something stronger:\r\n`senseless chatter, needless noise, committing oral\r\nnuisance'?  Uriel Weinreich's dictionary gives ?talking\r\nnonsense.?\r\n\r\n            Misha Allen of this city and I are, respectively,\r\nsecretary and president of the AAA, the Anti-Aleichem\r\nAssociation.  It is an organization that\r\nstands on guard against the practice by cataloguers,\r\nlibrarians, and critics and reviewers of truncating\r\nthe name Sholem Aleichem and producing a (Mr.)\r\n?Aleichem.?  This nom de plume, as is known,\r\nmeans `Peace Be Upon You' and it strikes us as absurd\r\nto see him referred to as ?Be Upon You? or Mr.\r\n?Upon You.? Even The New York Times is a frequent\r\noffender.  I recently read Life After Death by the Canadian\r\nwriter Tom Harpur.  He makes reference to\r\nthe eighteenth-century Jewish mystic Israel Baal\r\nShem Tov and a paragraph later refers to him as\r\n?Tov?--a similar misunderstanding.  Sholem\r\nAleichem is a single expression and he who bisects it\r\ncommits nothing less than literary homicide.  I mention\r\nit now as we have just marked the 75th anniversary\r\nof his death and his name has been appearing\r\nhere and there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            To David L. Gold's comments [XVIII, 1] on Leslie\r\nDunkling's review of A Dictionary of Surnames\r\n[XVII, 4, 11] I would like to add one remark: not\r\nonly is the list of the author's personal acknowledgments\r\nfar longer than their bibliography of printed\r\nsources consulted (as Gold notes), but even if a certain\r\nwork appears in the bibliography, that does not\r\nnecessarily mean they relied on it.\r\n\r\n            Here is an example from my own field, Jewish\r\nfamily names: the bibliography lists Benzion C.\r\nKaganoff's A Dictionary of Jewish Names and Their\r\nHistory , but the few times this work is cited in A\r\nDictionary of Surnames , a disclaimer follows immediately\r\nto the effect that no support could be found for\r\nKaganoff's explanation (at the name Gordon for instance).\r\n\r\n            It is not surprising that no credence was attached\r\nto Kaganoff.  A review of his book in Onoma\r\n(23, 1, 1979, pp. 96-113) begins: ?a disappointment,\r\n[which] can be recommended neither for the\r\nspecialist nor for the novice....  The number of\r\nerrors in citation and analysis is staggering....\r\nKaganoff is ignorant of most of the relevant literature.?\r\n(Further severe criticism appeared in Jewish\r\nLanguage Review 5, 1985, pp. 363-376 and 6,\r\n1986, pp. 416-418).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            It is not my normal practice to respond to unfavorable\r\nreviews of my books, since obviously a reviewer\r\nis entitled to his or her own views, attitudes\r\nand prejudices when assessing a work.  One takes\r\nthe rough with the smooth, like most things in life.\r\nBut when a reviewer misrepresents what one has\r\nwritten, I feel a counter is called for.\r\n\r\n            The review of my Bloomsbury Dictionary of\r\nDedications [XVII,4] made no mention of the fact\r\nthat the quoted dedications are glossed or explicated.\r\nTo ignore this fact is to treat the book as if it\r\nwere a dictionary of headwords with no accompanying\r\ndefinitions or etymologies.  The reviewer quotes\r\nfive dedications (misquoting one) and merely says\r\nthey seem to him ?neither funny nor clever.?  They\r\nare actually not meant to be either.  But the whole\r\npoint of the apparently trivial dedication by Mary\r\nStorr [?I dedicate this book to my friends?] is that\r\nthe names of 200 individual friends follow, making\r\nthe dedication something of a record.  And when\r\nRoger McGough dedicates his poems for children\r\n?to those who gaze out of windows when they\r\nshould be paying attention? he is punning on the\r\ntitle of the book, which is In the Glassroom (not\r\nClassroom , as misquoted: ironically, in view of the\r\nreviewer's own article in the same issue on ?Accuracy\r\nin Quotations?!).\r\n\r\n            It also seems odd to me that the reviewer should\r\nnot be curious about the meaning of the strange\r\nname in the dedication ?To my dear friend, Hommy-Beg.?\r\nIt is when one discovers that the dedicatee\r\nwas a Manxman, and that the words are Manx for\r\n`Little Tommy' that one feels the nice sense of satisfaction\r\nthat a detective must feel when he has at last\r\nunraveled a long baffling clue.  But this gloss on the\r\ndedication is omitted in the review, leaving the\r\nreader no wiser than before.\r\n\r\n            Incidentally, the reviewer of A Dictionary of\r\nFirst Names , by Patrick Hanks and Flavia Hodges, is\r\nwrong to state that ?they choose to ignore Hugo .?\r\nThey don't: it is included as a variant of Hugh .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            Permit me a few observations on Don Webb's\r\naddendum [XVII, 2] to Harry Cohen's ?Jingo Lingo?\r\n[XVI, 4].\r\n\r\n            The former's statement that ?[t]he French\r\nwords for junkie are toxoman and morphinman , neither\r\nof which merits official use? leaves me puzzled.\r\nI've never seen (or even heard) the words toxoman\r\nor morphinman , though I wouldn't swear that no\r\nFrenchman anywhere has ever used them.  There\r\nare, indeed, many words invented from pseudo-English\r\nwith the suffix - man (e.g., barman `bartender';\r\nrecordman `record-holder'; and dozens of others),\r\nbut I don't believe that Mr. Webb's two examples\r\nare among them.  On the other hand, the common\r\nterms morphinomane and toxicomane (note spellings)\r\nnot only ?merit official use? but have been in\r\nthe language for quite some time (ca 1900 and 1920\r\nrespectively), as have numerous other nouns--e.g.\r\nm?galomane, coca?nomane, h?ro?nomane, ?th?romane,\r\netc.--ending in the similarly pronounced\r\nbut very different Greek-rooted suffix - mane .  ( Belle\r\nEpoque specialists will recall the celebrated night-club-performer-cum-anatomical-wonder Le\r\nP?tomane, much admired for his ability-- mirabile\r\nrectu! --to fart [ p?ter ] in near-perfect tune, unto every\r\nsharp and flat(ulence), and with great brio, and\r\nwhose rendition of La Marseillaise is said to have\r\nbeen particularly memorable.)  For that matter, the\r\nword junkie itself was even adopted into the French\r\n?in? slang of the eighties-- le fran?ais branch? --\r\nalong with the less common addict , more often reserved\r\nfor figurative use.  An addict du foot , for example,\r\nis a soccer junkie.\r\n\r\n            While on matters Gallic I would point out, in\r\nregard to Don Sharp's article in the same issue\r\n[XVII, 2], that, though not as addicted to the practice\r\nas American English, French is also given to creating\r\nwords from letter abbreviations.  Note, for example,\r\nsuch slang forms as b?d? (from BD, bande\r\ndessin?e `[sophisticated] comic strip'); elp? (from LP ,\r\ni.e., `long-playing record'); and jit? (from JT, journal\r\nt?l?vis? `television news broadcast').  Along the same\r\nlines, though somewhat more involved, is the word\r\np?cu `toilet paper' (from PQ , itself a punnish abbreviation\r\nof papier cul ), which has also come to mean a\r\npompous piece of writing, with the corresponding\r\nverb p?cufier .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            Jack Orbaum [EPISTOLAE, XVII, 4] wants to\r\nmake readers aware of what he calls a ?mistranslation?\r\nin the Bible.  He directs readers' attention to\r\nthe King James version of Isaiah 7:14: ?Behold a virgin\r\nshall conceive and bear a son....?  He also\r\ncites the New Testament passage in Matthew\r\n1:22-23 which speaks of Jesus as the fulfillment of\r\nthis passage from Isaiah: ?Behold a virgin shall be\r\nwith child....?  He then cites modern translations\r\nof Isaiah which read ?young woman? instead of\r\n?virgin.? He calls these ?corrections of the original\r\nmistranslation.?\r\n\r\n            Mr. Orbaum is correct regarding the translation\r\nof the Hebrew word in Isaiah 7--the word ` almah\r\nmeans `young woman,' and also correct that the Hebrew\r\nword betulah means `virgin.'  However, in several\r\nrespects he has either misinterpreted the data\r\nor has not taken into account the relationship between\r\nOld and New Testaments in regard to ancient\r\ntranslations.\r\n\r\n            1.  The word ` almah which appears in Isaiah\r\n7:14 can be translated `young woman' or `maiden' or\r\n`woman of marriageable age.'  It is a general term\r\nand can refer to any young woman.  While it is not a\r\nspecific indicator of virginity, it is not used to mean.\r\nthat the woman is no longer a virgin.  In fact,\r\nRebekah, the woman sought as a wife for the son of\r\nAbraham, is referred to as ` almah in Genesis 24:43.\r\nRebekah's virginity was never in question and she\r\nwas referred to as ` almah , not betulah .  Therefore,\r\nMr. Orbaum is incorrect when he says that the Hebrew\r\nbetulah ?would have been used in the original\r\nhad the young woman been a virgin.?  The word\r\n` almah allows the possibility that the woman was a\r\nvirgin.\r\n\r\n            2.  That there is a relationship between Isaiah 7\r\nand Matthew 1 is correct.  The gospel cites the passage\r\nfrom Isaiah ?a virgin shall be with child...?\r\nand considers it to be fulfilled in Jesus.  But, is the\r\npassage in Matthew a ?mistranslation?? Why does\r\nthis gospel use the term virgin?  Matthew's gospel\r\nwas certainly not influenced by an ?original mistranslation?\r\nfrom the King James Bible!\r\n\r\n            There is more than one question here: Did the\r\ngospel of Matthew misquote the Bible?  Which Bible\r\nwas this gospel using as a source?\r\n\r\n            The New Testament community used a Greek\r\ntranslation of the Bible, not the original Hebrew.\r\nWhen the gospel writers read Isaiah 7:14 in the\r\nGreek, they read parthenos , the Greek translation of\r\n` almah .  This term had a narrower range of meaning\r\nthan ` almah , and more specifically meant ?virgin,?\r\nbut it was within the range of equivalence for the\r\nHebrew term ` almah .  The gospel writer did not misquote\r\nthe Bible in this matter.  The gospel writer\r\nread the Greek translation and related this passage,\r\nas well as many others, to Jesus.\r\n\r\n            3.  The Greek translators of the Hebrew Bible\r\nsome 300 years or more before the composition of\r\nthe New Testament were not misquoting the Hebrew;\r\nthey were doing the difficult work of translation\r\nfrom one language into another.  As all of us\r\nwho love words know, translators are not mechanics\r\nwho simply replace a word in one language by another\r\nword identical in meaning.  Translators are interpreters.\r\nThey look for the word or phrase which\r\nwill best bring to the audience of their time the text\r\nbeing translated.\r\n\r\n            Translators of the King James Bible had the\r\nsame task as did the Greek translators centuries before:\r\nto make this ancient text accessible to the readers\r\nof their day.  What texts did the King James\r\ntranslators use?  They had Greek and Hebrew texts\r\nof the Bible, and they used these in their work.  The\r\ntranslators of the King James Bible were translating\r\nthe Bible for a Christian audience; for them, the Bible\r\nconsisted of the Old Testament and the New Testament.\r\nWhen they read the Hebrew and Greek\r\ntexts of Isaiah 7, and the Greek text of Matthew 1,\r\nthey had to decide which terms from the common\r\nlanguage would best express what was in the ancient\r\nmanuscripts.  The adoption of the term virgin was\r\nnot a mistranslation: it was a judgment of the translators\r\nbased on the texts which they had before them\r\nand the audience for which the translation was intended.\r\n\r\n            Bible translators today as a general rule prefer\r\nto translate from the original languages--for the Old\r\nTestament (or Hebrew Bible), Hebrew and Aramaic,\r\nfor the New Testament, Greek.  However, when the\r\nreading is unclear or ambiguous, difficult or corrupt,\r\nthe translator will turn to other translations or versions\r\nto see how ancient translators rendered passages\r\nin question.  Bible translators today must also\r\ntake into account their audience as they translate.\r\nThe New English Bible is addressed to an English\r\naudience, the New American Bible an American audience.\r\nThe New Revised Standard Version has as\r\npart of its translation agenda the elimination of language\r\nwhich has been made sexist by the limitations\r\nof English.\r\n\r\n            We must be cautious in our assessments of translations\r\nto be aware of the subtleties of translation\r\nbefore we too quickly attach the label ?mistranslation.?\r\nThat Christians and Jews have different interpretations\r\nof a number of passages in the Bible is\r\napparent.  The availability of many excellent translations\r\ntoday affords readers a chance to see how a\r\nvariety of first-rate translators read and interpret ancient\r\ntexts.  Different interpretations by excellent\r\nscholars are far different from mistranslations.  The\r\nmodern translations of Isaiah which are cited above\r\nare legitimate translations; the King James translation\r\nis also a legitimate translation of Isaiah 7, not a\r\n?mistranslation.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            It appears that I am becoming the champion of\r\n?mistranslations.?  Some time ago I came to the defense\r\nof St. Jerome and his ?mistranslation? which\r\ngave Moses horns.  Now I feel compelled to respond\r\nto Jack Orbaum's interesting letter [EPISTOLAE, XVII,\r\n4] about the ?mistranslation? of the Hebrew word\r\n` almah in Isaiah 7:14, which Mr. Orbaum says ought\r\nnot be translated `virgin' but `young woman.'\r\n\r\n            As readers of VERBATIM well know, it is simplistic\r\nto assume that there is but one correct translation\r\nof any given word.  `Almah is no exception.  It almost\r\nsurely does mean `young woman,' but it can also\r\nmean a `girl,' `maiden,' `bride,' `youthful spouse,' a\r\n`woman of marriageable age' or `the age of puberty'\r\n(according to Gesenius-Robinson, my trusty 1888\r\nHebrew and English Lexicon).  It is not difficult to\r\ninfer virginity from some of these usages (at least in\r\nBiblical times when virginity prior to marriage was\r\nexpected of a woman).  My old lexicon also points\r\nout, as does Jack Orbaum, that the customary word\r\nfor `virgin' is bethulah, not `almah .\r\n\r\n            That brings us to the Septuagint, the Greek\r\ntranslation of the Hebrew Old Testament ?said to\r\nhave been made by 72 Palestinian Jews during the\r\nthird century B.C. at the command of Ptolemy Philadelphus...\r\nthis version of the Bible was used in\r\nMediterranean lands during the time of Christ and\r\nthe early Church.?  (William Rose Ben?t, The\r\nReader's Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., 1968) The Septuagint\r\ntranslates `almah in Isaiah 7:14 as parthenos.\r\nThayer's Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament\r\nsays of parthenos: ?a virgin... (fr. Hom. down;\r\nSept. chiefly for bethulah, several times for na`arah;\r\ntwice for `almah ...).?  So we see that the Greek\r\nword ?chiefly? chosen by the Septuagint scholars to\r\nmean parthenos is the word bethulah , which Mr.\r\nOrbaum stresses is ?the Hebrew word for virgin .?\r\nBut the Jewish scholars of the Septuagint also chose\r\nthe word parthenos to translate `almah in Isaiah\r\n7:14, where one might have expected a less specific\r\nword.  It becomes very muddy.  Gesenius-Robinson,\r\nby the way, translates bethulah as ?a virgin pure and\r\nunspotted,? ?a virgin just married,? and ?a young\r\nspouse? (see Joel 1:8, where bethulah is translated\r\nby the Septuagint as nymphe, ?a betrothed woman, a\r\nbride,? ?a recently married woman, young wife?--\r\nThayer).  The Jerusalem Bible, in a footnote to the\r\nword ?maiden? (as `almah is translated by them in\r\nIsaiah 7:14) says:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greek version reads ?the virgin,? being\r\nmore explicit than the Hebr. which uses almah,\r\nmeaning either a young girl or a young, recently\r\nmarried woman.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            A more recent commentary on Isaiah 7:14 may\r\nbe helpful here, or may simply muddy the waters\r\nfurther.  Carl Stuhlmueller, C.P., in ?Psalm 46 and\r\nthe Prophecy of Isaiah Evolving into a Prophetic,\r\nMessianic Role? in The Psalms and Other Studies on\r\nthe Old Testament, 1990, writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n... we return to Isa 7:14 and especially the Septuagint\r\nrendition of `alma.  As is well known, this\r\nGreek text renders the word with the technical\r\nword for virgin, parthenos, not with what one\r\nwould expect, neanis--young maid, the Greek\r\nword which is deliberately put in place here in\r\nthe ancient Greek versions of Aquila, Symmachus\r\nand Theodotion.  We suggest that the Septuagint\r\nsees the maid as Jerusalem, the virgin spouse of\r\nthe Lord.  The text of Isaiah, therefore, resounds\r\nwith extraordinary richness: the mysterious, marvelous,\r\nfertile ways of new life, accomplished\r\nsolely by the Lord through Israel's faith.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Innumerable chapters and verses might be cited\r\nwithout a definitive answer and without convincing\r\nany one side of the debate that `almah unquestionably\r\nmeans, or does not mean, `virgin' in Isaiah 7:14.\r\nIt may be worth noting here that Martin Luther used\r\nthe word Jungfrau to translate `almah , bethulah , and\r\nparthenos .  Jungfrau , although referring almost exclusively\r\nto `virgin' in present-day German, has the\r\nliteral root sense of `young woman,' or `young wife.'\r\nThe English word virgin itself comes from the Latin\r\nvirgo , which can mean `virgin,' `maiden,' or `young\r\nwoman' and which reflects the same ambiguity as\r\nthe other languages.\r\n\r\n            Translation cannot be an exact science, and so\r\nwe may never know precisely what the author of\r\nIsaiah 7:14, or the author of Matthew 1:23f, meant.\r\nIsaiah's authors (and there were most likely more\r\nthan one) were poets.  Matthew's author(s) had an ax\r\nto grind and sought to prove a point by using a\r\nrabbinical-style proof-text argument.  In either case,\r\nwe must not expect these writers to use words as we\r\nshould like them to have done.  Some translators are\r\npoets or teachers, too, and we must not expect them\r\nnecessarily to respond to words in our fashion, either.\r\nI would make a plea that we all be a bit more\r\ncareful in our use of the term ?mistranslation.?\r\n\r\n            It remains unclear to me on whom Mr. Orbaum\r\nwould pin the blame for what he calls ?the original\r\nmistranslation.?  He seems to suggest that somehow\r\nwe should fault the group of translators who produced\r\nthe King James Version of the Bible, but, as\r\nwe have seen, the confusion lies not so much with a\r\ngroup of sixteenth century English scholars as with\r\nthe very nature of the art of translation.  The Christian\r\nChurch, nevertheless, chose to latch on to the\r\nconcept of the Virgin Birth long before the sixteenth\r\ncentury ( cf . Tertullian, who lived c. 160-240 A.D.) in\r\nany case, and we do not know whether the use of\r\nIsaiah 7:14 was to justify an already extant belief\r\nwith a text, or whether it was to take an already\r\naccepted text and graft its meaning, as was then understood,\r\nupon the events of the Annunciation to\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n            Ultimately, it seems, one's reading here comes\r\nmost likely from religious orientation rather than\r\nfrom ?correctness? of translation.  We agree to disagree\r\nand, meanwhile, enjoy the richness of languages\r\nand the art of playing among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            Writing Maketh an Exact Man\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            The title is taken from one of Sir Francis Bacon's\r\nsententious essays one read as a schoolboy.  As\r\na writer, I wish it were true.  But precision and accuracy\r\nare elusive virtues, and any number of pitfalls\r\nlie in the trail.  Herewith is an account and plausible\r\nexplanation of a few howlers committed by competent,\r\nexperienced writers in books and articles I\r\nhave read in recent months.\r\n\r\n            In her fine biography, Nora: The Real Life of\r\nMollie Bloom (Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1988),\r\nBrenda Maddox feels impelled to flesh out the account\r\nof Nora's life, which revolved largely around\r\nher husband, by describing the decoration of their\r\nflat in the Square Robiac.  The walls were hung with\r\n?family portraits (women in big bonnets and men in\r\nred hunting coats) and his reproduction of a\r\nVermeer view of Ghent.?  Alas, no: it was a street in\r\nDelft.  Vermeer was born, lived, painted, and died in\r\nDelft.  He never, so far as we know, visited Ghent,\r\nbeautiful as it is.  How did the geographical mistake\r\noccur?  Maddox, far too young to have visited the\r\nJoyces in Paris, was relying on an account by Arthur\r\nPowers in The Joyce We Knew , who had visited the\r\nJoyces in the 1930s and who had mistaken the city.\r\nThe point was not checked by the copy editor, probably\r\nan inexperienced B.A. in English Lit., underpaid\r\nby the publishers, and the lapsus appears in the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n            Faulty geography is the basis for an error in Peter\r\nWinch's review of Hans Blumenburg's Holenausg?nge\r\nthat appeared in the usually faultless Times\r\nLiterary Supplement [October 13-19, 1989].  He\r\nstarts with a bit of name-dropping, one of the minor\r\nsins of academic reviewers, to show his familiarity\r\nwith the great names of 19th-century German philosophy,\r\nand continues with, ?Johann Bachofen, colleague\r\nof Friedrich Nietzsche and Jacob Burckhardt\r\nat Z?rich University...?  Alas, Dr. Winch, who\r\nteaches philosophy at the University of Illinois at Urbana,\r\nhas mistaken Z?rich for Basel, where they\r\nwere both members of the same faculty, ca . 1870s.\r\nSuch inaccuracies in the opening sentence of a book\r\nreview fail to inspire confidence.\r\n\r\n            At a different level of inaccuracy are some\r\nlapses in Robert Craft's new book, Small Craft Advisories ,\r\na collection of clever essays on musical topics.\r\nCraft set himself up as Stravinsky's amanuensis, and\r\nhis apercus are well worth reading; but when he mislabels\r\nthe tile of Philip Larkin's Required Writing as\r\nRequired Reading , he kills Larkin's playful title.  He\r\nalso refers to Mozart's first love, Aloyisia Weber,\r\nConstanze's older sister, as Aloysius, creating a sexual\r\nambiguity that even Peter Sellars did not dare\r\nhint at in Amadeus .  Aloysius was the name of Sebastian\r\nFlyte's teddy bear in Brideshead Revisited , but\r\nnot the given name of Mozart's first love.  The error\r\nsuggests sloppy proofreading.\r\n\r\n            More egregious are errors committed because\r\nthe writer or speaker is ignorant of the facts.  In a\r\nrecent BBC Symposium on the ethics of genetic engineering\r\n[October 22, 1989], George Steiner, the\r\nOxford pundit and master of the mandarin style,\r\ntook the negative view, largely because the margin\r\nfor error was too great.  In addressing the question\r\nof antenatal treatment of congenital diseases, he\r\nclaimed that had we been able to treat congenital\r\nsyphilis, we would have lost the genius of Beethoven.\r\nThis is simply untrue.  Beethoven did not have\r\ncongenital syphilis, a disabling disease that usually\r\nproduces driveling idiots.  Whether he acquired\r\nsyphilis as an adult has been suggested and debated,\r\nbut the evidence seems to be against it.  But Professor\r\nSteiner's rhetoric and video-camera style were\r\nso persuasive that it was easy to overlook the fact\r\nthat his argument (or part of it) was based on a complete\r\nmisstatement of the facts.\r\n\r\n            The same charge of ignorance can be leveled at\r\nFrederick R. Karl, whose biography William Faulkner,\r\nAmerican Writer (New York, Weidenfeld & Nicolson,\r\n1989) has many fine literary insights.  But we\r\nread medical information such as ?At 1:30 A.M. on\r\nJuly 6, just seven-and-one-half hours after admission\r\nto Wright's Sanitarium, William Faulkner died...\r\nThe diagnosis was definitely coronary thrombosis, in\r\nwhich a piece of fat that has formed on the vein wall\r\nbreaks away and blocks the passage of blood in the\r\nvein; the result, loss of blood flow, heart stoppage,\r\nalmost immediate death.?  Karl is a Professor of\r\nAmerican Literature at N.Y.U., but had he checked\r\nwith the Pathology Department he would have\r\nlearned that coronary thrombosis occurs in arteries,\r\nnot veins, a fact that many laymen without medical\r\neducation know, and that it is not ?fat? that forms on\r\nthe wall of coronary arteries but atheromatous\r\nplaque.\r\n\r\n            Ignorance of anatomy was the cause of a gross\r\nerror in an article I read in a travel magazine on a\r\nrecent flight to Europe.  Writing in Clipper Magazine ,\r\nthe Pan-Am house organ, Barbara Gibbons recounts\r\nher experience in drinking slivovitz during a\r\nrecent trip to Yugoslavia: ?A fiery plum brandy, its\r\nalcohol content ranges from 25 per cent ( mekana,\r\nsoft) to 55 per cent ( ljuta , hot).  Mine was ljuta , and\r\nit burned a path down my trachea to the pit of my\r\nstomach.?  Unless Gibbons has an uncorrected tracheoesophageal\r\nfistula (hardly likely), her trachea is\r\nin continuity with her bronchi and lungs.  If she aspirated\r\nslivovitz into her respiratory tract, she would\r\nbe coughing from the time she wrote the article until\r\ntoday.  One can drink slivovitz, even ljuta , with\r\nimpunity, provided it goes down the esophagus.\r\n\r\n            Lastly, errors creep in because the writer is\r\nmaking up local color.  This is not unlike reconstructing\r\na supposed conversation and setting it\r\ndown as direct discourse.  In The Patriarch: The Rise\r\nand Fall of the Bingham Family , Susan Tifft and Alex\r\nJones describe the arrival of Mary Caperton, later\r\nthe wife of George Barry Bingham, Sr., into Radcliffe:\r\n?In September 1924 Mary climbed aboard a\r\ntrain with Louise Burleigh and set out for Radcliffe.\r\nOnce in Boston, the pair motored along the Charles\r\nRiver, where the trees were just beginning to take\r\non their vivid autumn color, and then crossed into\r\nCambridge.?  Not so!  They probably piled their\r\nbaggage into a taxi either at South Station or Back\r\nBay Station, drove out Commonwealth Avenue and\r\nBay State Road, crossing the Charles at any of several\r\npossible bridges.  But the trees along both sides\r\nof the Charles do not begin to turn color until mid-October.\r\nRegistration at Radcliffe was usually between\r\nSeptember 15th and 20th, but the authors are\r\nNew Yorkers, and from some deeply suppressed latent\r\nhostility, New Yorkers usually manage to get it\r\nwrong when they write about Boston or Cambridge.\r\nPerhaps they don't speak the same language.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Verba scripta manent , so goes the Latin tag, and\r\nthe printed word carries weight, even when it is inaccurate.\r\nEven the graffiti in Pompeii carry weight\r\nand are subject to scholarly exegesis, though they\r\nwere written in haste and there was no leisure to\r\nrepent.  If there is a moral to these anecdotes, it is\r\nthat writers cannot be too careful.  One recalls the\r\nadvice given by the aged Martin Joseph Routh\r\n(1755-1854), President of Magdalen College, Oxford,\r\nto an undergraduate: ?Always verify your references,\r\nsir!? Check and double check.  That is why\r\nthey put erasers on pencils.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            There Just Isn't a Word for It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            When the devil gets the upper hand in me,\r\nI like to tease my Spanish and Spanish-American\r\nfriends about some of the words their language\r\nlacks.  I tell them that when a specific word\r\nfor a thing or a function is lacking in a language it\r\nmust indicate that the thing or the function itself is a\r\nconcept that is either unknown or is considered unimportant.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Schedule , for example.  Spanish doesn't have a\r\nword for it.  You can say timetable (horario) , and you\r\ncan proyectar something, or programar it.  But that\r\nis as near as you can come to a one-word translation\r\nof the meaning.  And I have noticed that it is no easier\r\nto find one word in Spanish that means schedule\r\nthan it is to explain to a Spanish speaker the range of\r\nmeaning in schedule in addition to that of timetable .\r\n\r\n            Speaking of meaning , you can't say ?Do you\r\nmean that?? in Spanish.  You can say ?Are you\r\nspeaking seriously?? which isn't quite the same\r\nthing.  When you want to ask ?What does that word\r\nmean??  you can ask ?What does that word signify??\r\nor ?What does that word wish to say? ? and thus take\r\ncare of that meaning of meaning adequately.  But if\r\nyou want to pin a Spanish speaker down with the\r\nequivalent of this useful term in English, you are\r\ngoing to have to be content to ask him if he is being\r\nserious, even if he happens to be dying with laughter\r\nover what he has said.\r\n\r\n            Are these things clues to the Hispanic character\r\nand culture?  I do not know, but they do provide\r\nmaterial for some glorious arguments.  There is no\r\nword for argument in Spanish, either, in that sense of\r\nthe word.  Argumento is a reasoning, or the plot of a\r\nstory or play.  If you had to find one word in Spanish\r\nfor our special meaning you would have to choose\r\namong the Spanish equivalents of discussion, debate ,\r\nor quarrel , none of which quite hits the mark.\r\n\r\n            Spanish has only one word for hope (esperar)\r\nbut esperar also means ` wait ' and ` expect ,' and if the\r\ncontext is not clear the Spanish speaker will not\r\nknow whether you are waiting for a bus, or expecting\r\none, or simply hoping that one will come along\r\neventually.\r\n\r\n            There is no exact word for drop in Spanish.  For\r\nthis term you need to use the word for fall , either\r\nwith the auxiliary let (lo dej? caer `I let it fall') or in\r\nthe reflexive (se me cay? `it fell itself to me) '.  Either\r\nway, who can blame you?  In one case you did it\r\npurposely, and in the other the object did it to you.\r\n\r\n            To speak of earning something you must use a\r\nword that also means winning .  The only word for\r\nchairman is presidente .  Chairmen do preside, of\r\ncourse, but to the English speaker steeped in a tradition\r\nof civic committees and PTA the functions of a\r\nchairman go beyond simply presiding.  To a Spanish\r\nspeaker, apparently, the head of a committee presides,\r\nand that is it.\r\n\r\n            Spanish had no word for leader , and so eventually\r\nthey borrowed ours, and can now often be heard\r\nto speak of a l?der .  On the other hand, we do not\r\nhave a word for caudillo .  The nearest we can come\r\nis probably boss or strong man , but these words do\r\nnot encompass the full Spanish meaning.\r\n\r\n            Which brings us to the subject of words Spanish\r\ndoes have that English lacks.  Lidiar , for example, is\r\nwhat a man does with a bull in a bullring, and to him\r\nthe process is not in the remotest sense a fight .  It is a\r\nlid , and if you do not understand that word you will\r\nnot understand him.\r\n\r\n            It may surprise anyone whose mind's eye sees\r\nthe typical Hispanic as a man in a funny hat sleeping\r\nin the shade of a saguaro cactus to learn that Spanish\r\ncan express with one word the concept of `getting\r\nup early in the morning.'  The verb is madrugar :\r\nmadrugo (`I get up early in the morning'); madrugas\r\n(`you get up early in the morning'); madruga (`he\r\ngets up early in the morning').\r\n\r\n            We have borrowed simp?tico , but I somehow do\r\nnot get the same pleasant glow from the word in an\r\nEnglish context that it arouses in Spanish speech.\r\n\r\n            Street demonstrations in Latin America resound\r\nwith simple cries we simply cannot duplicate in English.!\r\nViva la patria!  (`Hurrah for the fatherland'?)\r\n!Mueran los dem?cratacristianos!  (`Kill the Christian\r\nDemocrats'?) !Solidaridad!  Poles would understand\r\nthat, but not we English speakers.\r\n\r\n            In contrast to the rather standoffish attitude of\r\nthe English language, Spanish is on familiar terms\r\nwith the deity and things holy or revered.  Why not\r\nname your son Jesus?  Or John of God?  You can\r\nname him Joseph Mary or Paul Mary , and nobody\r\nwill think the less of him.  And why not call your\r\ndaughter Conception , or Sorrows (Dolores)?  Or why\r\nnot search the calendar of saints and holy days for\r\nnames for the newborn?  I have even heard of country\r\nboys named Circuncisi?n , but I have never met\r\none.\r\n\r\n            We are hard put to bring into normal English\r\nthe diminutive endings that tend to adorn Spanish\r\ndiscourse with such interesting furbelows: caballito,\r\nmujercita, amiguito, autito .  There is no hesitancy\r\nabout using even a double diminutive, as in chiquitito.\r\nChico would be `little,' chiquito would be `tiny,'\r\nor perhaps `teeny-weeny,' and chiquitito could only\r\nbe `teensy-weensy,' I suppose.\r\n\r\n            In his Growth and Structure of the English Language,\r\nOtto Jespersen noted how few diminutives\r\nEnglish has, and how little it uses them.  He thought\r\nthat the use of diminutives ?produces the impression\r\nthat the speakers are innocent, childish, genial\r\nbeings, with no great business capacities or seriousness\r\nin life.?  Jespersen may have overstated the\r\ncase, but there is no doubt that whereas no Hispanic\r\nmale would hesitate to call a little pig a chanchito ,\r\nfew American men would care to be heard calling\r\none a piglet .\r\n\r\n            Nor, at the other end of the scale, can we match\r\nthe Spanish superlative suffix - ?simo , e.g., grand?simo,\r\nalt?simo, bell?simo (rendered in English as the `biggest,'\r\nthe `highest,' the `most beautiful,' although for\r\nan exact equivalency one would use the other superlative\r\nform in Spanish, m?s grande, m?s alto, m?s\r\nbello ).  Nothing I have ever heard in English can\r\nmatch the breadth of lighthearted insult expressed by\r\na Spanish wit some years ago who used the suffix with\r\nreference to the notoriously pampered, well-connected,\r\nwell-heeled, well-placed brother-in-law\r\n( cu\r\n?ado ) of Francisco Franco.  He called the generalissimo's\r\nbrother-in-law el cu?ad?simo .\r\n\r\n            When your language can do that, who cares\r\nwhether it can schedule things or hope for them, or\r\ndrop them?\r\n\r\n            \r\n               !Viva el espa?ol!\r\n            \r\n         \r\n         \r\n            If you move, please send change-of-address notice to the\r\noffice nearer to you, either in Aylesbury or in Indianapolis.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            The Power of Doubled Words\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            In a recent column on etymologies, Attorney General\r\nRichard Thornburgh and Defense Secretary\r\nRichard Cheney were cited for their use of willynilly\r\n(Atlantic Monthly , March 1990).  Thornburgh\r\nstated that ?he did not favor a `willy-nilly' U.S. military\r\ncommitment? in Latin America and Cheney\r\n?decried ... `willy-nilly' cuts in defense spending\r\nproposed by some lawmakers.?\r\n\r\n            By using willy-nilly rather than more formal\r\nterms such as ?whether desired or not? ( American\r\nHeritage Dictionary ), they were turning to a minor\r\nword pattern in English called `reduplication,' meaning\r\na partial or complete duplication of a given word.\r\nMany languages use this doubling pattern, some extensively.\r\nHawaiian, having only fourteen letters in\r\nits alphabet, resorts to doubling frequently.  Some examples\r\nare lahi `thin, frail,' lahilahi `weak' (coffee,\r\netc.) and wiki `hurry,' wikiwiki `hurry up.'\r\n\r\n            Reduplication uses two devices that help make\r\nlanguage powerful and memorable--rhyme and\r\nrhythm.  Also, the usage level of English doubles is\r\nusually informal or colloquial; and when placed in a\r\ncontext of standard English, a double can make a\r\nsentence sparkle.\r\n\r\n            Among the several types of doubles in English, a\r\nrather large group ends both parts with the diminutive\r\nsuffix - y or - ie .  The group seems also to contain\r\ntwo similar sub-groups that produce opposite effects:\r\nthose that diminish size and express endearment\r\nor amusement and those that diminish stature\r\nor worth and express disapproval or contempt.\r\nAmong the first group are many children's words--\r\nGeorgy-Porgy, Henny-Penny, Turkey-Lurkey, kitchy-kitchy,\r\nlippity-lippity, piggly-wiggly .  Among the second\r\nare fuddy-duddy, funny-money, hoity-toity,\r\nhokey-pokey, namby-pamby, shilly-shally, silly-billy,\r\nticky-tacky, wishy-washy , and the double cited\r\nabove, willy-nilly .  The power gained through rhyme\r\nand rhythm seems to be directed by the diminutive\r\nsuffix toward favorable or unfavorable meanings.\r\n\r\n            During the Watergate scandal President Nixon\r\nhad to face an even more powerful combination, one\r\nthat incorporated his own nickname in a double that\r\nended with the negative diminutive - y .  Whoever\r\ncoined the term tricky-dicky must have sensed that\r\nthe combination would hit hard.\r\n\r\n            Perhaps the two Bush administration officials, or\r\ntheir writers, were aware of objections to the positions\r\nattributed to them and decided to take the initiative,\r\nThornburgh by distancing himself from those\r\nfavoring a `willy-nilly' commitment of troops in\r\nLatin America and Cheney by blaming members of\r\nCongress for urging `willy-nilly' proposals to cut the\r\ndefense budget.\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            J?y ... Bang!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Those interested in the magic of onomasiology\r\nmight note the following full names with the initial\r\nletter J and the terminal letter y seemed destined for\r\nfame and infamy:\r\n\r\n\r\nVictims: John F. Kennedy\r\n         John B. Connally\r\n         James Brady\r\nGunmen:  Jack Ruby\r\n         James Earl Ray\r\n         John W. Hinckley\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Tragedies are not limited to the ?J--y? phenomenon,\r\nof course.  Consider Lee Harvey Oswald,\r\nwhose ?L--d? becomes LD , medical jargon for `lethal\r\ndose.'\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n            The article by Bill Bryson [XVII, 4] on the vagaries\r\nof English abroad unfortunately also serves to\r\nillustrate the lack of linguistic understanding which\r\nexists between our two countries.\r\n\r\n            Specifically, the first illustration given is ?Full-O-Pep\r\nLaying Mash,? which is presented as if it were a\r\nnonsense phrase.  In fact, of course, ?Full-O-Pep?\r\nand many variations thereon were, and perhaps still\r\nare, common trade names of a variety of animal feed\r\nproducts.  And laying mash, as any farmer knows, is a\r\nform of chicken feed so formulated as to enhance egg\r\nproduction.  In the cited example, the feed manufacturer\r\nwas even named--which should have been a\r\nclue to the author, although the terminal part of the\r\nphrase (1091 DS) admittedly baffles me.\r\n\r\n            One wonders whether the author is the Bill Bryson\r\nwho wrote The Lost Continent--Travels in Small\r\nTown America .  If so, the mistake is doubly surprising,\r\nas that BB was born (?) and raised in Iowa, then\r\nmoved to England.\r\n\r\n            I am addressing this to you since I don't have\r\nthe address of the journal of original publication\r\n( The Independent ), and hope that word may eventually\r\ndrift back to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \r\n         \r\n            \r\n?Controlling emissions at the source not only protects\r\nfreshwater ecosystems, but also allows fairly rapid\r\nrecovery of lakes' indigent species...?
