Chatterbox had promised to publish his official\r\n\"1999 In Review\" item before Thanksgiving, but some distant memory of a scruple\r\npersuaded him to wait till November was over. Nothing ever happens in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n            OK, that's not quite true. Hordes of protesters in\r\nSeattle are making the World Trade Organization's meeting there a much more\r\nexciting TV story than anyone expected it to be. Reader Dan Crist (who\r\nfinds Chatterbox's habit of referring to himself in the third person \"rather\r\nannoying and less than professional\") points out that Japan bombed Pearl Harbor\r\nin Dec. 1941. Also, Chatterbox (moonlighting as \"Today's Papers\"\r\ncolumnist) observed not quite one year ago that the House of Representatives\r\ncast its second presidential-impeachment vote in U.S. history on Dec. 19, 1998.\r\n(That same news-filled day, the U.S. ended an air war against Iraq and Bob\r\nLivingston said he'd decided not to become House speaker after all.) Two months\r\nafter the impeachment vote, the Senate failed\r\nto convict the president--a highly significant event of 1999 that, for some\r\nbizarre reason, slipped Chatterbox's mind until several indignant readers wrote\r\nin to remind him of it.\r\n\r\n            By now, it should be clear that Chatterbox isn't much good at year-in-review\r\njournalism. Fortunately, Chatterbox's readers are very good at it. He will now\r\nturn this survey over to them.\r\n\r\n            ( Disclaimer: Although Chatterbox previously stated that he wouldn't\r\ninclude opinions he disagreed with, that standard proved too confining. Where\r\nChatterbox has solid information or opinions to the contrary, he occasionally\r\ninterjects below. Obviously stupid or unnecessarily sour reader comments were\r\ndiscarded, but if you don't find your nominee below it doesn't necessarily mean\r\nthat it was obviously stupid or unnecessarily sour. )\r\n\r\n            Here are 20 important things that happened in 1999:\r\n\r\n            1.

The honor went to Reform Party candidate Donald Trump, who managed to\r\nmake an unfavorable impression upon some 70 percent of those polled. The paper\r\nnoted that this achievement far eclipsed the last comparably negative\r\nrating--the 55 percent score attained by Linda Tripp. Presumably this came as\r\nno surprise to Mr. Trump, who, upon announcing the formation of a presidential exploratory\r\ncommittee on Oct. 7, 1999, had cited polls with \"amazing results\"--a\r\nremark that was widely misinterpreted at the time.\r\n               \r\n\r\n               -- Jodie Allen of U.S. News & World Report (and frequent\r\n\r\n                     Slate\r\n                   contributor)\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            2.

But Americans are still fixated\r\non northern Asia--Clinton says he must deal with China, because \"you can't\r\nignore a billion people with nuclear weapons,\" but his own policy toward India\r\nshows that you sure can!\r\n               \r\n\r\n               --Jim Chapin\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            3.

A Lunatic Rhapsody for the \r\n               New York Yankees\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                   The Yankees can actually\r\nbe referred to as the glue that held the century together. Of course, as the\r\n1999 World Series champions, they are a significant \"story of the year.\"\r\nHowever, this one singular achievement must be considered in a broader\r\ncontext.\r\n               \r\n\r\n               1999 represented the team's 25th championship of the century. This beats, by\r\none, the most championships any one team won during the century. The Montreal\r\nCanadiens have won 23 Stanley Cups. However, the Yankees, an American team,\r\nplaying in the \"City of the Century\" (so called by me to reflect the amazing\r\ngrowth and transformation of one city during this period), who play the\r\n\"National Pastime,\" are truly an amazing story.\r\n\r\n               The team's first championship occurred in 1921; therefore, they have won 25\r\nof the last 78 years, nearly one in three. This level of sustained excellence\r\nis not matched in sports or in any other aspect of society. The 1999 win is\r\npossibly the most unique. With free-agency, expansion, and three levels of\r\nplayoffs, it is much harder to win today than in past years. In fact, by\r\nwinning three of the last four championships, they are the first team to\r\naccomplish this feat during the eras of free-agency and of divisional play.\r\n\r\n               The Sultan of Swat, the Iron Man, the Yankee Clipper, the Mick, and\r\nYogi--these strong, masculine names are synonymous with the team, the sport,\r\nand American history. They went hand in hand with two world wars, Superman, and\r\nAmerica's superpower status. The 1999 squad does not feature \"a name.\" This\r\nteam, with its myriad of human-interest stories, its international roster, and\r\nno star, is representative of '90s man, male sensitivity, Pax American\r\ninterests, and the new political paradigm.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            --Jim Landau from North Potomac, Md.
