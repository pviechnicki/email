But Morris, having stumbled upon a juicy story,","priority":"Normal","contentType":"multipart/alternative","sentDate":"2017-11-06T23:56:47","importance":"Normal","plainTextBody":"\r\n   \r\n   \r\n      \r\n         \r\n             The Third Edmund Morris\r\n\r\n            Even if you haven't cracked Dutch , you know\r\nabout Edmund Morris and his semi-fictional namesake. And you probably haven't\r\navoided a third Edmund Morris: the tireless promoter who dogs your\r\nchannel-surfing. Strangely, this Edmund Morris on the gab-show circuit begs to\r\ndiffer with Edmund the Writer. Where Edmund the Writer can be cleareyed about\r\nhis subject, calling Reagan \"banal\" and an \"airhead,\" Edmund the Promoter fawns\r\nlike a Reaganaut, constantly trumpeting a \"great president.\" Whereas Edmund I\r\nclaims he only made up Edmund II, Edmund III weaves tales that are flatly\r\ncontradicted in Edmund I's book.\r\n\r\n            A striking instance of\r\ninter-Edmund strife comes from last Friday's Larry King Live . There,\r\nEdmund the Promoter told how Ronald Reagan almost joined the Communist Party.\r\nAnd why didn't he? \"The party elders heard about his desire to join, realized\r\nat once that Reagan was not doctrinary material. He was too open and too\r\nhonest, and he couldn't be trusted to keep party secrets. So they asked him\r\npolitely to stay the hell away.\"\r\n\r\n            But Edmund the Writer tells a very different version of the\r\nsame story in Dutch . He quotes writer Howard Fast, a party stalwart.\r\nAccording to Fast, when Reagan tried to join, \"the local Party leader asked\r\naround, and word came back Reagan was a flake ... [who] couldn't be trusted\r\nwith any political opinion for more than 20 minutes.\"\r\n\r\n            So Edmund I writes that\r\nRonald Reagan was too stupid for the Communists, and then Edmund III improves\r\nthe story for television by making him too virtuous. (Defending the\r\ncontradiction, Morris says, \"flaky means he couldn't be trusted with secrets.\")\r\nOnce you start making stuff up, apparently, it's harder to stop than you think.\r\nBut which Edmund is correct? Maybe neither. It turns out that even Edmund the\r\nWriter may have been embroidering more than his own role.\r\n\r\n            D utch devotes three pages to the CP episode.\r\nNearly half of this three-page stretch consists of Morris' conversation with\r\nFast, presented as screenplay dialogue. It is a dramatic scene with Fast\r\ndishing a shocking piece of information that the obsessed biographer has never\r\nheard before. Morris pours on the color--they are in a reception at the New\r\nYork Public Library's Astor Hall, they shake hands, they are wearing tuxedos,\r\nthe buzz of billionaires is in the background, and so on.\r\n\r\n            But these are all Red\r\nherrings, distracting from the fact that the scene is a silly vehicle for\r\nexploring Reagan's flirtation with communism. Fast never claims to have met\r\nReagan or to have had firsthand knowledge of Reagan's application to join the\r\nparty. The Astor Hall reception was the only time he and Morris spoke, Fast\r\nsays. Fast now admits to recycling gossip, \"This was a story told to me at a\r\ndinner party. I can't remember who told it.\" Historian Ronald Radosh notes that\r\nFast has a reputation for \"inconsistently remembering his time in the party,\"\r\nincluding contradictory recitations in his two memoirs. But Morris, having\r\nstumbled upon a juicy story, never seriously questions Fast's reliability or\r\npokes logical holes in his account.\r\n\r\n            Morris does recount his attempts to nail down Fast's story.\r\nHe describes conversations with three Reagan acquaintances, including the actor\r\nEddie Albert. Morris does not say that Albert was a party member, but he\r\nstrongly hints that Albert and his wife operated on \"behalf of the CPUSA.\"\r\nAlbert confirmed for Morris that Reagan did indeed discuss joining the party\r\nand was ultimately dissuaded. But Morris writes that when he tried to question\r\nthe aged actor further, \"Albert caged up as expected.\"\r\n\r\n            Oddly, when I called\r\nAlbert, he was anything but cagey. In fact he couldn't stop screaming into the\r\nphone: \"Reagan was a nice guy, but he was stupid. He didn't have a clue about\r\nany Russia business. He talked about being a Communist. We all did. But he\r\nnever did anything about it. One night my wife sat down and told him the party\r\nwas a load of crap.\" But was this just a ploy? Were Albert and his wife\r\nsecretly Communists, conspiring to keep Reagan out of the party? \"No.\" Did\r\nMorris ask Albert this question? \"[Morris] is an asshole,\" says Albert. And\r\neven Fast can't confirm what Morris implies, \"I have no idea whether Eddie was\r\nin the party or not.\"\r\n\r\n            Eddie Albert may be lying, of course, and corroborating the\r\nFast version of events may not be possible. But there are gaping holes in\r\nMorris' reporting that can easily be filled with a few phone calls. For\r\ninstance, Fast told Morris that Reagan dealt with a local party leader, \"a\r\nwell-known screenwriter, a playwright, a historian.\" Fast wouldn't identify\r\nthis person to Morris and Morris doesn't mention any attempt to track him down.\r\nBut only one Hollywood character fits this bill: John Howard Lawson, the dean\r\nof Hollywood Reds who reemerged to become Reagan's political foe in the late\r\n'40s. And Fast confirmed to me that he was talking about Lawson.\r\n\r\n            Or Morris could have contacted Dorothy Healey, who\r\nwas the chair of the Southern California Communist Party during the '40s.\r\nHealey told me: \"This has to be apocrypha. It's nonsense. Of course, we never\r\nrejected people for being too flaky. And if Reagan had been rejected, I would\r\nhave definitely heard about it.\" And in an interview, the authorized biographer\r\nconcedes that he didn't investigate thoroughly: \"Arthur Schlesinger once told\r\nme that he had dirt on Reagan buried in his filing system. But I never went\r\nafter him.\"\r\n\r\n            Although the Communist Party episode is one of\r\nMorris' most oft-mentioned scoops, he didn't even have it first. Howard Fast\r\ntold essentially the same story in the New York Observer eight years\r\nago. (And probably has been dining out on it for decades.) Yet Morris did\r\namazingly little to try to nail it down. But who has time to dig for facts when\r\nyou've got to make up not one but two different fantasies?\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
