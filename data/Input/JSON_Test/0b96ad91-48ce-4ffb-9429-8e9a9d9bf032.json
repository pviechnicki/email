I can't remember a thing about the conference itself,\r\nalthough my impressions of the food and wine--this was my first adult visit to\r\nthe city--remain vivid. The only thing I do remember is a conversation over\r\ndinner ( canard aux olives ) with an adviser to the new government, who\r\nexplained its plan to stimulate the economy with public spending while raising\r\nwages and maintaining a strong franc.\r\n\r\n            To the\r\nAmericans present this program sounded a bit, well, inconsistent. Wouldn't it,\r\nwe asked him, be a recipe for a balance of payments crisis (which duly\r\nmaterialized a few months later)? \"That's the trouble with you Anglo-Saxon\r\neconomists--you're too wrapped up in your theories. You need to adopt a\r\nhistorical point of view.\" Some of us did, in fact, know a little history.\r\nWasn't the plan eerily reminiscent of the failed program of Leon Blum's 1936\r\ngovernment? \"Oh no, what we are doing is completely unprecedented.\"\r\n\r\n            The French have no monopoly on intellectual pretensions or\r\non muddled thinking. They may not even be more likely than other people to\r\ncombine the two. There is, however, something special about the way the French\r\npolitical class discusses economics. In no other advanced country is the elite\r\nso willing to let fine phrases overrule hard thinking, to reject the lessons of\r\nexperience in favor of delusions of grandeur.\r\n\r\n            To an\r\nAnglo-Saxon economist, France's current problems do not seem particularly\r\nmysterious. Jobs in France are like apartments in New York City: Those who\r\nprovide them are subject to detailed regulation by a government that is very\r\nsolicitous of their occupants. A French employer must pay his workers well and\r\nprovide generous benefits, and it is almost as hard to fire those workers as it\r\nis to evict a New York tenant. New York's pro-tenant policies have produced\r\nvery good deals for some people, but they have also made it very hard for\r\nnewcomers to find a place to live. France's policies have produced nice work if\r\nyou can get it. But many people, especially the young, can't get it. And, given\r\nthe generosity of unemployment benefits, many don't even try.\r\n\r\n            \r\nTrue, some problems are easy to diagnose but\r\nhard to deal with. If George Pataki can't end rent control, why should we\r\nexpect Jacques Chirac to be able to cure Eurosclerosis? But what is mysterious\r\nabout France is that as far as one can tell, absolutely nobody of consequence\r\naccepts the obvious diagnosis. On the contrary, there seems to be an emerging\r\nconsensus that what France needs is--guess what?--more regulation. Socialist\r\nleader Lionel Jospin's idea of a pro-employment policy is to require employers\r\nto pay workers the same money for fewer hours--an idea that was popular with\r\nvoters, the recent election results would suggest. Even conservative Phillipe\r\nSeguin, regarded as an iconoclast by French standards because he has questioned\r\nthe sacred goal of European monetary union, thinks that one way to add jobs is\r\nto ban self-service pumps at gas stations.\r\n\r\n            Beyond\r\nmore of the same, what does the French elite see as the answer to the nation's\r\nproblems? For more than a decade its members have sought salvation in the idea\r\nof Europe--that is, a unified European economy (under French leadership, of\r\ncourse), with common regulations and a common currency. In such a continental\r\nmarket, they imagine, France can once again prosper.\r\n\r\n            Now a unified European market is a pretty good idea. There\r\nis even a reasonable case for unifying Europe's currencies--although there is\r\nalso a good case for doing no such thing. (There is a whole industry of\r\npeople--Eurologists?--who make a living by debating that issue.) But to\r\nacknowledge the potential virtues of European economic integration risks\r\nmissing the essential fatuousness of the whole project. France's problem is\r\nunemployment (currently almost 13 percent). Nothing else is even remotely as\r\nimportant. And whatever a unified market and a common currency may or may not\r\nachieve, they will do almost nothing to create jobs.\r\n\r\n            Think of\r\nit this way: Imagine that several cities, all suffering housing shortages\r\nbecause of rent control, agree to make it easier for landlords in one city to\r\nown buildings in another. This is not a bad idea. It might even slightly\r\nincrease the supply of apartments. But it is not going to get at the heart of\r\nthe problem. Yet all the grand schemes for European integration amount to no\r\nmore than that.\r\n\r\n            \r\nIndeed, in practice the dream of European unity\r\nhas actually made things worse. If you are going to have a common currency,\r\neverything we know suggests you should follow what Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen\r\ncalls the Nike strategy. But instead of just doing it, European nations agreed\r\nto a seven-year transition period during which they would be required to meet a\r\ncomplex set of criteria--mainly to reduce their budget deficits while keeping\r\ntheir currencies strong.\r\n\r\n            There is\r\nnothing wrong with balancing your budget. In fact, European nations need to do\r\nsome serious fiscal housecleaning. And as the happy experience of America under\r\nBill Clinton has shown, it is quite possible to reduce the deficit and increase\r\nemployment at the same time. All you need to do is cut interest rates, so that\r\nprivate spending takes up the slack. But you can't cut interest rates if you\r\nare obliged to keep your currency strong. So the Maastricht Treaty (the\r\nblueprint for European currency union) ensured that the budget-cutting it\r\nrequired would be all pain and no gain. Nobody can make a precise estimate, but\r\na guess is that without Maastricht, France might have an unemployment rate of\r\n10 percent or 11 percent. Not great, but a couple of points better than\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n            While some French politicians have been willing to say nice\r\nthings about budget deficits, nobody seems willing to challenge the dogma that\r\nEuropean integration is the answer. Even Seguin the iconoclast declares that\r\n\"the fight against unemployment is inseparable from the realization of the\r\ngrand European design.\"\r\n\r\n            But let us\r\nnot blame French politicians. Their inanities only reflect the broader tone of\r\neconomic debate in a nation prepared to blame its problems on everything but\r\nthe obvious causes. France, say its best-selling authors and most popular\r\ntalking heads, is the victim of globalization--although adroit use of red tape\r\nhas held imports from low-wage countries to a level far below that in the\r\nUnited States (or Britain, where the unemployment rate is now only half that of\r\nFrance). France, they say, is the victim of savage, unrestrained\r\ncapitalism--although it has the largest government and the smallest private\r\nsector of any large advanced country. France, they say, is the victim of\r\ncurrency speculators, whose ravages President Chirac once likened to those of\r\nAIDS.\r\n\r\n            \r\nThe refusal of the French elite to face up to\r\nwhat looks like reality to the rest of us may doom the very European dreams\r\nthat have sustained the nation's illusions. After this last election it is\r\nclear that the French will not be willing to submit to serious fiscal\r\ndiscipline. Will the Germans still be willing to give up their beloved deutsche\r\nmark in favor of a currency partly managed by France? It is equally clear that\r\nFrance will not give up its taste for regulation--indeed, it will surely try to\r\nimpose that taste on its more market-oriented neighbors, especially Britain.\r\nThat will give those neighbors--yes, even Tony Blair--plenty of reason to\r\nhesitate before forming a closer European Union.\r\n\r\n            But if it turns out that\r\nChirac's political debacle is the beginning of a much larger disaster--the\r\ncollapse of the whole vision of European glory that has obsessed France for so\r\nlong--we can be sure of one thing: The French will blame it all on someone\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
