Charging varying amounts for driving at\r\npeak and off-peak times will cut down on congestion and pollution. Revenues\r\ncould fund public transportation. A profile salutes pathological downsizer\r\n\"Chainsaw\" Al Dunlap for having the guts to fire workers in order to turn\r\ncompanies around. The profile also asserts that Dunlap's slash-and-burn\r\ntechnique would be ineffective for all but the sickest firms.

In this week's Economist , a computer that\r\ncan improvise jazz. Its programmer enters parameters of style and tempo. The\r\ncomputer's getting better: Many experts can no longer distinguish it from a\r\nlive musician.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               \r\n                  New\r\nRepublic , Dec. 22\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nFriday, Dec. 5)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Following\r\nNewsweek 's lead, TNR puts Amistad , Steven Spielberg's new\r\nfilm about a slave revolt, on the cover. Among four related stories: a rave\r\nreview for the film and an appreciation of John Quincy Adams, a major\r\nAmistad character and \"one of the only genuine intellectuals ever to\r\noccupy the White House.\" An article says the Russian military is too weak to\r\ninvade other countries (good news), but also too weak to prevent its soldiers\r\nfrom selling arms to terrorists (bad news). Also, a report from the Rev. Moon's\r\nmass-marriage ceremony: Most of the newlyweds will go back to their own\r\nhometowns after the wedding. They may or may not see their spouses in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               \r\n                  New\r\nYork Times Magazine , Dec. 7\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nThursday, Dec. 4)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Yet\r\nanother \"special issue\"--the fourth in three months. The subject of the 20-odd\r\nstories: American religion. A story follows a Muslim teen-ager living in\r\nsuburban Virginia. Her classmates ridiculed her head scarf, so she took it off.\r\nHer mom doesn't like her punk nose ring, but she leaves it in. An article\r\ndescribes a new medical study about prayer: When devout \"healers\" prayed for\r\nthe health of arthritic patients--without the patients' knowledge--the\r\npatients' health improved. Doctors are dubious. A Unitarian recounts her\r\nepiphany: A voice in the woods told her to become a minister. Also, kudos for\r\nthe Alabama Freethought Association, a league of atheists in the heart of the\r\nBible Belt. They meet on Sundays and lampoon Christians: \"Right about now,\"\r\nsays one, \"the folks in town are sitting in church, waving a book that makes no\r\nsense and that most of them haven't even read.\"\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                  Time and Newsweek , Dec. 8\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nTuesday, Dec. 2)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The mags discover the same\r\ntrend: the exodus to exurbia. Time 's cover story on small towns follows several couples who\r\ngave up fast-track lives to settle down in villages. Why the migration?\r\nTelecommuting and the great job market make mobility easier than ever. A\r\nshorter Newsweek story labels these dropouts \"Young Unhappy\r\nProfessionals\" (unhappy, that is, till they drop out).\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Newsweek 's cover\r\npackage, pegged to the release of Steven Spielberg's film Amistad ,\r\nassesses the legacy of slavery. Among the conclusions: A national apology for\r\nslavery would be hollow and facile, but America should erect a slavery memorial\r\non the Mall. Newsweek interviews John Hope Franklin, chairman of the\r\npresidential advisory board on race. (He's against an apology, and for\r\naffirmative action. See \"The Sound of One Hand Talking\" for \r\n                  Slate\r\n               's take on\r\nFranklin and the panel.) An accompanying review raves about Amistad\r\n(though the magazine inexplicably calls it \"controversial\").\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Time breaks the news that Bill Ford Jr. will become chairman of\r\nFord in 1999. Ford, who has been running the family-owned Detroit Lions for the\r\npast two years, will be the first Ford to head the automaker in a decade.\r\nTime also reports on the making of Titanic . The film cost\r\n$200 million, and its producers are terrified. Director James Cameron\r\ncontributes a short defense of his movie, but an accompanying review pans it:\r\ngreat special effects, hackneyed story.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               \r\n                  U.S.\r\nNews & World Report , Dec. 8\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nTuesday, Dec. 2)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               U.S.\r\nNews kicks off the Christmas shopping season with a cover\r\nstory on junk mail. Lots of insider info about how junk mailers reel you\r\nin: real stamps, pseudo-official envelopes, and \"P.S.\" messages. Some high-end\r\nretailers make more money by selling their mailing lists than by selling their\r\nproducts. (Requisite statistic: On average, each American receives 553 pieces\r\nof junk mail a year.) A story praises the Trinity Foundation, a Christian community in\r\nTexas that investigates fraud by televangelists and publishes a Christian\r\nsatire magazine called the Door . The annual\r\nguide to personal finance advises investors to stop worrying about\r\ninflation: It's gone.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               \r\n                  The\r\nNew Yorker , Dec. 8\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nTuesday, Dec. 2)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            An\r\narticle chronicles Rupert Murdoch's quest to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers.\r\nMurdoch, who has decided that sports will be his international TV anchor, is\r\ntrying to monopolize broadcast rights for California sports teams. But Atlanta\r\nBraves owner and Murdoch rival Ted Turner may try to block approval of\r\nMurdoch's $311-million Dodgers bid. A profile of the vice president takes the\r\nusual Gore psychoanalysis a step further. It agrees that Gore's outer\r\nrobotic-ness masks a warm jocularity, but argues that the warm jocularity\r\nitself masks Gore's fundamental emotional coolness. Gore admits that his \"no\r\ncontrolling legal authority\" press conference was a mistake. A \"Comment\" by\r\nRobert Reich argues that Republicans and Democrats have switched places.\r\nRepublicans used to be the party of \"noble aspirations\" and Democrats used to\r\nbe the party of \"just causes.\" Now Democrats tout bland aspirations (like\r\nracial healing) while Republicans fervently champion causes like tax reform and\r\nschool vouchers.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                  Weekly Standard , Dec. 8\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nTuesday, Dec. 2)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            A cover\r\nstory makes the case for national education reform. Decentralization, the usual\r\nconservative solution, isn't helping schools. National policies could increase\r\nthe number of charter schools, cripple local education bureaucracies, and limit\r\nthe power of evil teachers unions. A piece calls Clinton's race commission the\r\n\"Disgrace Commission.\" It's a group of affirmative-action supporters appointed\r\nto rubber-stamp Clinton policies, the article says. The most interesting\r\nsection of the magazine is the letters page, where gay-rights advocates\r\nexchange fire with William Bennett over Bennett's recent piece attacking\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n
