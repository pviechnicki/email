Norm Scharf lured me to Florida\r\nwith promises of sunshine, warm temperatures and the chance to\r\nfollow Gene Del Polito on a panel. It was cloudy, the temperature\r\nnever got above 45 degrees Fahrenheit and, after listening to Gene\r\nproselytize about postal reform, I tried to enlist!\r\nEarlier this year, Norm invited me to the April 14th GCA\r\nconference in Clearwater, Florida. \"How could I resist,\" he asked,\r\n\" a chance to get a head-start on my summer tan?\" It rained---the\r\nentire time!\r\nWhen Norm called in June to ask if I would participate in an\r\nR2000-1 postmortem conference, I agreed on the condition that (1) I\r\nspeak before Gene and (2) that I not be subjected to Florida's\r\nerratic weather.\r\nNorm, I see that Gene's performance is tomorrow---afternoon. So,\r\nI want to thank you on meeting my first condition.\r\nOn your meeting my other condition, what can I say Norm but\r\nthank you. It certainly is a pleasure to be here in Chicago---in\r\nDecember!\r\nNow before you get upset with me, I think you need to know the\r\nreal reason we are in Chicago---in December. How many of you know\r\nNeal Denton? Neal who is on the\r\nprogram tomorrow---with Gene---is rabid. Oops, I mean he is a\r\nrabid baseball fan. So much so that he tries to see at least one\r\ngame at each major league diamond every year. Well, as I heard the\r\nstory, Denton was leaning into the plate in fantasy baseball camp\r\nlast winter when he took a high, inside, fast ball on the head.\r\nEver since he has been more confused than usual. Apparently he\r\nthought the Cubbies and the Chisox had a home and home inter-league\r\nseries this week. So, he convinced Norm to hold the conference out\r\nhere so he could get a \"two-fer\" on that every ballpark every year\r\ndeal.\r\nBy the way, for those of you who want the straight skinny on why\r\nI'm leaving the Commission, that's Denton's fault, too! He told me\r\nthat there is a \"three strikes and you're out\" rule for\r\ncommissioners on omnibus rates cases. And, judging from the\r\ncomments some of you have been making, it appears that I didn't\r\nmake it to first base in the R2000-1 game. I've got to tell you,\r\nthough, that most industry comments pale by comparison to some of\r\nthe suggestions I received from the general public on what I can do\r\nwith the 34 cent stamp.\r\nSeriously, though, I know some of you are not all that happy\r\nwith a number of the Commission's recommendations. I will speak to\r\nsome of the concerns of which I have become aware. And, while I do\r\nnot mean to suggest that I view anyone's concerns as being\r\nparochial, I think it might be useful to set the broader stage of\r\npostal ratemaking---to lay out the general principles that guide\r\nthe Commission's conclusions. I also plan to spend a few minutes\r\ndiscussing the state of USPS finances and mention a couple of other\r\nmatters of more than passing interest---at least to me, and I hope\r\nto you.\r\nThe law that established the US Postal Service in 1970 provides\r\nthat the Postal Service may, from time to time, request that the\r\nPostal Rate Commission recommend \"rates and fees [that] shall\r\nprovide sufficient revenue so that the total estimated income?to\r\nthe Postal Service will equal as nearly as practicable the total\r\nestimated costs of the Postal Service.\"\r\nBut the Commission isn't free to make just any old\r\nrecommendations so long as the numbers add up. It has to act in\r\naccordance with the general policies set forth in the Postal\r\nReorganization Act and nine specific ratemaking factors.\r\n\r\n? 3622. Rates and fees\r\n(1) the establishment and maintenance of a fair and equitable\r\nschedule;\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)\r\nthe value of the mail service actually provided each\r\nclass or type ofmail service to both the sender and the recipient,\r\nincluding but not limited to the collection, mode of\r\ntransportation, and priority of delivery;\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)\r\nthe requirement that each class of mail or type of mail\r\nservice bearthe direct and indirect postal costs attributable to\r\nthat class or type plus that portion of all other costs of the\r\nPostal Service reasonably assignable to such class or\r\ntype;\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)\r\nthe effect of rate increases upon the general public,\r\nbusiness mailusers, and enterprises in the private sector of the\r\neconomy engaged in the delivery of mail matter other than\r\nletters;\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)\r\nthe available alternative means of sending and receiving\r\nletters andother mail matter at reasonable costs;\r\n\r\n\r\n(6)\r\nthe degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the\r\npostal systemperformed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing\r\ncosts to the Postal Service;\r\n\r\n\r\n(7)\r\nsimplicity of structure for the entire schedule and\r\nsimple, identifiablerelationships between the rates or fees charged\r\nthe various classes of mail for postal services;\r\n\r\n\r\n(8)\r\nthe educational, cultural, scientific, and informational\r\nvalue to therecipient of mail matter; and\r\n\r\n\r\n(9) such other factors as the Commission deems appropriate.\r\nFactor number three deserves special mention as it is the\r\nmandatory factor. It is at the heart of many a difference of\r\nopinion between the PRC and the Service, the Service and mailers,\r\nmailers and the PRC, and between groups of mailers. It is the\r\nfactor that causes the Commission to examine all operational costs,\r\nfrom collection to delivery and the processing that takes place in\r\nbetween. It is the bedrock on which rates are based. Each subclass\r\nmust generate sufficient revenue to cover its costs. This policy is\r\nimportant for another reason. It, combined with factor number six,\r\nforms the basis for the many, important work-sharing discounts that\r\nare on the books.\r\nIt seems to me that, at times, critics of Commission\r\nrecommendations tend to take lightly the considerations embodied in\r\n39 USC 3622(b)(3) and (6). \"How come,\" they ask, \"did we wind up\r\nwith an increase that was larger than that proposed by the USPS,\r\nwhen almost everyone else got a break?\" There are usually a number\r\nof reasons that situations like this occur. For example, the\r\nCommission believes that costs vary more directly with volume than\r\ndoes the USPS. As a consequence, the PRC costing methodology\r\ngenerally attributes a larger portion of total operating costs than\r\ndoes the Service.\r\nBut why not even things out by ignoring cost differentials\r\nbetween, say, letters and flats; cost differential put on the table\r\nby the USPS a decade ago? Why not just look the other way on these\r\ncost differences, or level the playing field by passing on to some\r\nmail 300 percent of costs avoided by work-sharing? Why not give\r\ndiscounts based on cost avoidances promised in a previous rate or\r\nclassification case but which savings were never captured by the\r\nPostal Service? Because it is one thing to encourage work-sharing,\r\nbut quite another to ignore the law, and give revenue away. And,\r\ngiving away revenue has an effect.\r\nKeep in mind the requirement that a subclass has to generate\r\nrevenue to cover its costs. Now, what happens when we give\r\nexcessive discounts for some type of mail? Simple! We have to make\r\nup the revenue from other mail, for example, by bumping up, if you\r\nwill, the benchmark from which those discounted rates are\r\nmeasured.\r\nOne rather formidable group of mailers whose members will\r\nbenefit mightily from the Commission's recommendations, the\r\nperiodicals mailers, pointed out in a press statement that the\r\noverall average increase for First-Class mail was much smaller than\r\nthe average increase for mail their members send. Does it matter\r\nthat the cost of processing their mail went way up and the cost of\r\nprocessing First-Class mail declined? Yes. By law, it must matter\r\nto the Commission!\r\nWhat if the Commission chose to ignore this divergence in costs\r\nand hit First-Class mail with a larger increase? Whose interest\r\nwould be served by our doing so and for how long?\r\n\r\n\r\nPRC R2000-1\r\n(Dollars in Millions)\r\nTotal Contribution to Institutional Costs: $25,453\r\nPackage Other Service 7.15% 0.89% $1,820\r\n\r\nPercent Contribution to Percent Institutional Percent Volume\r\nRevenue Cost\r\n\r\nTotal 100.0% 100.0% 100.00%\r\n1/ Includes Priority Mail\r\nI want you to take a moment to look at this pie chart. I think\r\nit is important for everyone to understand the extent to which\r\nFirst-Class mail is already carrying a disproportionate share of\r\nthe institutional cost or overhead burden of the postal system.\r\nNow, forget about this rate case and put aside any notion that I am\r\nsuggesting others mailers should pay a larger share. Think instead\r\nabout the discussion---the hand wringing--- that has been taking\r\nplace since the fall of last year when the General Accounting\r\nOffice unveiled an assessment prepared for the Postal Service by a\r\nPostal Service contractor concerning the extent to which\r\ntransaction mail---First-Class mail---is likely to fall prey to\r\nelectronic bill presentment and payment. Should we load up on that\r\ntype of mail---give it heftier increases? Might not doing so just\r\naccelerate the departure of this mail from the system? When that\r\nmail leaves the system, who gets to eat that big slice of the\r\ninstitutional cost pie that First Class mail currently enjoys?\r\nNow, remember a few minutes ago when I talked about the\r\nCommission and Postal Service difference of opinion on the matter\r\nof how costs vary with volume? In the USPS view of the world,\r\ninstitutional costs are a larger share of total costs and fewer\r\ncosts can be expected to be shed, if and when, say, transaction\r\nmail leaves the system. This means, potentially, an even bigger\r\nslice of institutional pie for someone else---one of you, to\r\nswallow. Not a pleasant prospect and not one easily avoided---not\r\neven by any reform package or proposal that I've seen.\r\nWell, I guess I have already crossed the line and gotten into\r\nsome specifics of the R20001 case. And, I did not paint a horrific\r\npicture of the future, just so you might think the present PRC\r\nrecommendation ain't so bad, after all. However, before I lose the\r\nforest---and a very important one it is---for the trees, I want to\r\nstep back a bit.\r\nIn my almost seven years at the helm of the PRC, if I have\r\nlearned nothing else, I've learned that each case presents a new\r\nchallenge. In this case the challenge lay in evaluating the\r\nService's request for additional funds over and above its expected\r\noperating expenses.\r\nLast January the Postal Service proposed an array of rate\r\nincreases designed to generate an additional $2.8 billion in\r\nrevenue. What was unusual about this request was that roughly $1.7\r\nbillion of these dollars was for a contingency, a hedge against the\r\nunknown---to cover unforeseen events. Another quarter billion plus\r\ndollars of the total amount sought was earmarked to pay down\r\noperating debt accrued in past years.\r\nThe size of the contingency quickly became a cause celebre with\r\nmany parties to the rate case. They sponsored evidence challenging\r\nthe need for a cushion so substantially above and beyond the Postal\r\nService's own best estimate of future increases in the cost of\r\ncollecting, processing and delivering the mail.\r\nAnd, as you probably know, in presenting estimates of its future\r\nneeds, the Postal Service used financial and operational data from\r\nfiscal year 1998 as a benchmark. Unfortunately, by the time the\r\nService filed its request, fiscal year 1999 had already come and\r\ngone. The Commission requested and the Postal Service completed an\r\nupdate of its original cost projections in mid-July.\r\nTo give you a flavor of the impact of this updating effort,\r\nwhich allowed the Commission to use more recent information than\r\nwas in the Service's initial package, let's look at a few of the\r\nchanges:\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nNotwithstanding the comments of one of the Postal\r\nGovernors at the November Board meeting about not being able to\r\nrecover increased fuel costs and the need for flexibility to permit\r\nthem to level a fuel surcharge, the USPS was able to factor into\r\nthe update the increased costs of fueling its delivery\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nDespite the comments of a Governor concerning costs\r\nassociated with the NALC arbitration, the USPS was able to include\r\nthese additional labor costs in the update.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nIt also was able to take account of the dollars\r\nassociated with actual cost-of-living adjustments, health insurance\r\nand the like, which were higher than earlier projected\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the update was not one-sided, only adding new costs, some\r\n$450 million. The Postal Service also presented additional revenue\r\nand costing-cutting initiatives, such as the billion-dollar-a-year\r\n\"break through productivity plan\" announced by the Postmaster\r\nGeneral this past spring. Unfortunately, the Postal Service was\r\nonly willing to commit to saving slightly more than one half the\r\nhighly publicized, promised amount.\r\nThe one item that did not change in the Postal Service update\r\nwas the contingency. The $1.7 billion remained.\r\nThe many parties who had already argued that a $1.7 billion\r\ncontingency was unreasonable before the update, were absolutely\r\ncertain that amount was unjustified given the incorporation of new\r\ncost data and shorter time frame for prognosticating.\r\nThe evidence presented by the parties on the contingency issue\r\nwas determinative. My colleagues and I, reduced the requested\r\namount by $700 million, leaving a $1 billion contingency. We\r\nconcluded that this amount more than met the reasonableness\r\nstandard of the law.\r\nNow, you should know that I put these remarks together over the\r\nweekend, before the December board meeting that took place Monday\r\nand Tuesday of this week. So, I had no idea of what action the\r\nGovernors might take. It would not surprise me, however, if the\r\ngovernors returned the case because we cut the contingency, if for\r\nno other reason than that the USPS views the contingency as its\r\nprivate sandbox and doesn't want the PRC playing there.\r\nNevertheless, I think the Governors should be quite happy with a\r\nbillion dollar contingency since, after all, at the board\r\nmeeting---at least some of the Governors apparently did not even\r\nknow there was a contingency provision. One Governor is said to\r\nhave remarked at the public meeting that he thought the Postal\r\nService needed some mechanism for recovering unforeseen\r\nexpenses!\r\nYou have already heard the doom and gloom projections about USPS\r\nfinances generally and about this Recommended Decision not\r\nproviding the Postal Service with sufficient revenue to breakeven\r\nin the current fiscal year. But think about this: if rate increases\r\nare implemented in January---which the Service has indicated is\r\nlikely---and the Service's best estimate from just this past July\r\nis on target, the Postal Service should be sitting on a sizable\r\ncushion at the end of this fiscal year. Put another way, based on\r\nthe evidence the Postal Service put on the record during rebuttal\r\nhearings as recently as this past August 30th, in the absence of\r\nthe occurrence of unforeseen events costing more than---the portion\r\nof the full $1 billion contingency earned when new rates are\r\nimplemented in January, $600 million, the Service should do quite\r\nwell with what we recommend.\r\nThis is, I believe, a good point to do a comparison of the\r\nevidentiary record the Commission based its decision on and the\r\nfinancial picture postal officials are now painting just three\r\nmonths later.\r\nUNEXPLAINED CHANGE IN USPS FY 2001 FINANCIAL POSIT ION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNEXPLAINED CHANGE IN USPS FY2001 FINANCIAL POSITION ($\r\nMillions)\r\nNet Income PRC R2000-1 Rate Decision - 11/13/00 1,342\r\nImpact of Jan. 2001 Delayed Rate Implementation (658)\r\nAdjusted FY 2001 Net Income 684\r\nOperating Plan - 11/14/00 (480) (Expected Net Loss)\r\nUnexplained Swing in Net Income: (1,164) (11/13/00 compared to\r\n11/14/00)\r\nI have a couple of tables I want to share with you. Each carries\r\nthe title \"Unexplained Change in USPS FY 2001 Financial\r\nPicture.\"\r\nThe first table is based on USPS assumptions regarding rates,\r\ncosts, volumes, contingency and recovery of prior years'\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nWhen the Service filed its case last January, we all were\r\ntold the net income for FY2001, after covering increased operating\r\ncosts, would be $1.9 billion---$1.7 billion for the contingency and\r\n$250 million for recover of prior years losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nWhen the Service filed its July update, which it could\r\nhave modified during rebuttal in late August, we were told the net\r\nincome for FY2001 would be $1.5 billion.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nWhen you adjust those figures for a January\r\nimplementation, you get a positive $630 million on the bottom\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nBut the USPS operating plan presented to and approved by\r\nthe Board in mid-November shows a deficit of almost $500 million\r\neven if the Commission had rubber-stamped the original Service\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nWhen ones substitutes generally lower PRC rates and uses\r\nall other USPS assumptions, one still gets a positive, albeit much\r\nsmaller, bottom line---the $132 million figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nGoing from a plus $630 million to a minus $480 million is\r\na swing of $1.1 billion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second table shows the numbers using PRC assumptions and\r\nrecommended rates.\r\nSo, regardless of whether one uses the Service's updated\r\nassumption or the Commission's rates and assumptions, there has\r\nbeen an unexplained swing of $1.1 billion in the projected bottom\r\nline for FY 2001 in just a couple of months!\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nWere the July-August updates that far off target? We now\r\nknow one figure, the FY2000 ink was not as red as the USPS thought\r\nit would be---the loss is $199 million as opposed to the $325\r\nmillion they projected last July. But that's good!\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nAre the November operating plan figures wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nHas that USPS commitment for half the promised \"break\r\nthough productivity\" fallen through?\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nHas something else happened?\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nIf so, what is the explanation?\r\n\r\n\r\nI know that some of you are unhappy with the Commission's\r\nrecommendations as they relate to your mail. I don't mean to be\r\nglib about your concerns, but if I were you, I might be more\r\nconcerned about the near-term rate implications of this $1.1 bottom\r\nline swing. For those of you who have only disdain for the current\r\nratemaking process---the length of time it takes and the cost of\r\nlitigation---please keep in mind that the PRC process affords the\r\nonly opportunity you may have to truly scrutinize this swing before\r\nyou get the next $1.1 billion plus kick in your billfold.\r\nNow, about our recommended rates: Could we have made different\r\nrecommendations? Most certainly! Would they have been better\r\nrecommendations? Maybe!\r\nBut let's look at the score card on how the several classes made\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nBy our count, roughly 87 percent of Standard mail will\r\nhave rates that are less than or equal to those proposed by the\r\nPostal Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nAlmost all Periodical mail rates will be lower than those\r\nproposed by the Postal Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nThe average increase in Parcel Post, save the not so\r\nsmall matter of a non-machinable surcharge that impacts about 3\r\npercent of total volume, is on target with the USPS\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nPriority Mail, Bound Printed Matter and Media Mail---gosh\r\nI'm having a hard time keeping up with all these name\r\nchanges---took a bit of a hit, 1 percent more, give or take, than\r\nthe USPS requested, based primarily on cost updates.\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nNonprofits benefited from last minute legislation and\r\nwill have smaller increases than would have otherwise been the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, we did not, as you know, lower the Standard pound rate\r\nas much as the Service wanted and we did not raise the breakpoint.\r\nTo those who choose to be supercritical of the Commission regarding\r\nour recommendations in these areas, I hope you will consider that\r\nratemaking generally involves a zero sum situation where one works\r\nagainst a revenue target. Lowering pound rates or raising\r\nbreakpoints may benefit some mailers, but it will also have a\r\nnegative impact on others who find themselves dealing, for example,\r\nwith higher piece rates and the like.\r\nI have a host of one-liners I've collected over the years that I\r\nthought about using at this point in response to some of these\r\ncritics who think we missed a \"no-brainer,\" but I won't do that.\r\nOne will suffice. It's the one that comes to mind when I think\r\nabout how smart I was before I actually had to deal first hand with\r\nan omnibus rate case. It's the H.L. Mencken line I've used before:\r\n\"For ever problem there is a solution that is simple, neat,\r\nplausible and wrong!\"\r\nLet's see now, where am I?\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nLay out guiding principles. Check!\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nTalk about rate recommendations. Check!\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nUSPS finances-the $1.1 billion swing. Check!\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nSaw barrel off shotgun and fire at critics.\r\nCheck!\r\n\r\n\r\n?\r\nI'm forgetting something. Ah, those other matters of\r\npassing interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll try not to take too long, but I get to do this because this\r\nmay be my last shot as Chairman of the PRC. And, you know what they\r\nsay---Today a peacock tomorrow a feather duster! So, here goes-\r\n(1) Postal or legislative reform or whatever you want to call\r\nit: I am NOT opposed to postal reform! I just believe, to quote his\r\nFebruary 28, 2000, MIDS article, that that great American, Mr. Cary\r\nBaer, had it right when he said, \"Before we develop solutions we\r\nneed to reach some consensus on the problem.\" We've all got our\r\ncampaign ribbons from the war of HR22. Some people want to pick up\r\nthat very tattered battle flag, put on their brightest red coats,\r\nform into straight lines and march one more time up Jenkin's Hill.\r\nFor those of you who may not know, Jenkin's Hill is the hill on\r\nwhich sits the U.S. Capitol. Price caps may sound more attractive\r\nwith every passing rate case. But, as I have tried to explain to\r\nsome of you, costs trumped caps in HR22; that is, you were still\r\nlikely to see increases akin to those you experience under current\r\nlaw. I propose that, rather than charging up the same hill with the\r\nsame old, tired ammunition, let's all of us regroup---and\r\nrethink.\r\n\r\nDilbert kind of sums it up for me when it comes to postal\r\nreform.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)\r\nA better bet for legislation in the 107th Congress, and\r\none that may be as important to the postal community as some\r\nperceive postal reform to be, is in the privacy area dealing with\r\nthe collection and sharing of personal data. This is an area I know\r\na bit about from a previous incarnation as the point man on\r\ninformation policy at the then Department of HEW in the 1970s.\r\nOverly restrictive privacy legislation at the federal level or,\r\neven worse, 50 different restrictive state bills could spell\r\ndisaster for everyone up and down the chain from graphics and copy\r\npeople to printers to cataloguers to envelope manufactures to banks\r\nand to shipping and logistics companies. You've got a split\r\ncongress and an issue with bipartisan appeal. Convincing\r\nconservatives of the benefits of federal preemption and liberals of\r\nthe benefits of limiting causes of action, both stumbling blocks in\r\nthe past, might be doable as 107th searches for common ground. The\r\nresult could be a framework everyone can live with.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3)\r\nNegotiated Service Agreements. Setting aside for the\r\nmoment the pros and cons of notice versus pre-approval, for some\r\ntime now I have been preaching that NSOs are by and large nothing\r\nmore that narrowly drawn or niche classifications. We've already\r\napproved several such USPS proposals. I urge the Service to move\r\nforward with whatever proposals they have developed. If mailers, a\r\nsmall group of or even one of them, can perform some task that may\r\ndrive costs out of the system, let's get on with\r\nit---now!\r\n\r\n\r\n(4)\r\nAnd last but not least, another Ed Gleiman suggestion---I\r\ntry to include at least one classification and/or cost savings\r\nproposal in each speech. This one is buried in a\r\n\r\n\r\nconcurring opinion to the R2000-1 decision. Certified Mail is\r\ncostly to the Postal Service and the consumer. Along with Return\r\nReceipt, also not cheap, these oldfashioned offerings are frequent\r\nrecipients of criticism from users. Delivery Confirmation, on the\r\nother hand, is a high tech, low cost service that works and works\r\nwell. By extending Delivery Confirmation to First-Class mail as a\r\nreplacement for Certified Mail, the potential exists to drive in\r\nexcess of $300 million per year in window clerk and letter carrier\r\ncosts from the system. I could be wrong about all this, and I don't\r\nwant to fall into my old buddy H. L. Mencken's simple solutions\r\ntrap, but that's a heap of money, and I think this one deserves\r\nsome prompt consideration by the folks at postal HQ!\r\nIt's pretty clear that some of you are tired of hearing from me\r\nand others, I gather from the snoring, are just plain tired. So, I\r\nbest wrap things up.\r\nWhen I talked with Bill Hoyt the other day, he said I was\r\nobligated to wrap up with a story or joke. I told him I didn't have\r\nany new material. He offered that hardly anyone ever listens to\r\nwhat I say anyway, so you all would not even know that I was\r\nrecycling old material. Let's see if he is right.\r\nJohn Nolan and I were talking about some of his\r\nresponsibilities. You know all those letters that kids write to\r\nSanta. Well, seems Bill Henderson used to handle the responses,\r\npersonally. Bill has delegated that and now those letters all go to\r\nJohn. Turns out that Bill got one letter last year that just tore\r\nat his heartstrings. A little boy wrote that since his father's\r\ndeath, his mother was having a hard time making ends meet. The\r\nlittle fellow asked nothing for himself, only that Santa send his\r\nmother $100. Well, the PMG, being the kind soul that he is, reach\r\nin his pocket, pulled out one of those nice, crisp, new $50 dollar\r\nbills and mailed it to the boy's mother. The boy wrote Santa again\r\nthis year, and the letter wound up in John's in box. He shared a\r\ncopy and I would like to share it with you.\r\nDear Santa, Thanks so much for all you did last Christmas.\r\nThings are still pretty rough for us, and my mom sure could use\r\nanother $100.
