Here is the text (superimposed on a","priority":"Normal","contentType":"multipart/alternative","sentDate":"2017-11-06T23:58:45","importance":"Normal","plainTextBody":"\r\n   \r\n   \r\n      \r\n         \r\n            Microsoft Leaks Own Plans for Coup D'Etat\r\n\r\n            Microsoft may want to reconsider the\r\nplacement of an advertisement Chatterbox spied this morning while riding the\r\nsubway into work. The ad was on the platform for the inbound red-line train at\r\nthe Judiciary Square station. Dedicated followers of the Microsoft antitrust\r\ntrial and savvy Washington insiders know this to be the subway stop for the\r\nfederal courthouse where Microsoft's fate is at this very minute being\r\ndecided. If the presiding judge in the Microsoft case, Thomas Penfield Jackson,\r\ntakes the subway to work, this is probably where he gets off in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n            It was therefore with some surprise that Chatterbox noticed that Microsoft\r\nplaced an ad in this spot for Windows 2000. Microsoft is widely suspected to\r\nharbor ambitions of world conquest, but it was Chatterbox's impression that the\r\ncompany wished to downplay any such ambitions while Judge Jackson considered\r\nwhether to break it up into itty-bitty pieces.\r\n\r\n            What, then, is one to make of this ad? Here is the text (superimposed on a\r\nphotograph of the American flag snapping in a stiff breeze):\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                  The biggest .com of them all isn't a .com at all.\r\nIt's the U.S. government, and it created the Internet.\r\nImagine what it can do with Windows 2000.\r\n               \r\n\r\n               Windows 2000: the government's business starts here. www.microsoft.com/federal\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The ad's intent, obviously, is to\r\ninvite government managers to consider the benefits of upgrading their computer\r\nsystems to Windows 2000. One could read the text as an innocent pitch for a\r\nnifty product that could help Uncle Sam do his job. But to Chatterbox, the tone\r\nseems further to suggest that the federal government is a big software company\r\nthat would be well advised to merge with another big software company called\r\nMicrosoft. If it doesn't ... well, who's to say whether those poor saps at the\r\nAgriculture Department will ever be able to keep track of the price of pork\r\nbellies? The \"government's business,\" after all, \"starts here .\"\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
