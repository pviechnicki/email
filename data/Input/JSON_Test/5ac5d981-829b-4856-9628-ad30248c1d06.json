But\r\nbefore we plunge headlong into spring--starting more seeds than we could ever\r\nhope to plant, scarfing up little wonders at nurseries because we simply\r\nmust have them--let us stop to consider the lesson of restraint to be\r\nlearned from the garden in winter.\r\n\r\n            People\r\noften assume that the winter garden, its flowers having died back, is devoid,\r\nwanting--gardenless. Each year, the gardening press rallies to remedy this\r\nmisimpression but only makes things worse. Solace is offered: story after story\r\non how to supply your garden with what is ubiquitously referred to as \"winter\r\ninterest.\" This consists of a seductive array of close-up photos of dangling\r\nberries and mottled, peeling bark designed to cure whatever ails your\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n            One problem with the term winter interest is that it\r\nimplies that winter is not very interesting. Another is the notion that we seek\r\nsomething as mealy and undistinguished as interest, rather than beauty, which\r\nis what we strive for come spring.\r\n\r\n            In their\r\ndefense, these articles do make us aware of these woody winter plants and of\r\nthe increasing diversity of cultivars available for winter gardening. Few\r\nthings bring me as much joy as the sight of my own swampy backyard, all\r\nleafless and brittle and dotted throughout with bright orange-red winterberries\r\nclinging to their branches. To see the monochromatic splendor of a wintry\r\nVermont wood, populated only by stands of dusky-white birches and smooth,\r\nsilver-gray beeches rising from the snow, is, I firmly believe, to live. The\r\ncraze for winter interest, on the other hand, has really become a fetish for\r\nanything that can be left poking out of the snow.\r\n\r\n            \r\nBut the garden as a whole can be beautiful in\r\nwinter, and it can teach us a lot about what makes a garden beautiful in\r\nsummer. Winter is a perfect time to visit gardens--not your neighbor's garden,\r\nperhaps, or a garden known mainly for its flower borders, but public gardens,\r\nhistoric private gardens, well-designed parks, and arboretums. Quieter and more\r\nevocative than in the high season, when teeming with camera-toting tourists,\r\nthey're more likely to reveal their secrets, their pasts, and their intentions.\r\nUndistracted by flowers or too much color, you can see tones, lines, shapes,\r\nand light--the garden's pure form.\r\n\r\n            A garden\r\nis created more through gestures than by any one plant. Structure, often\r\nreferred to as \"bones,\" is created through architectural elements such as\r\nevergreen hedges, arrangements of trees and shrubs, walls, terraces, and\r\nflights of stairs. The placement of these things affects the spatial perception\r\nof the ground, the sides, and the roof plane of the garden. Once you have\r\ncreated such a garden \"room,\" you can furnish it with any seasonal delights you\r\nlike. The bones of the garden are not put in place merely to console you when\r\nyou peer from the window in winter; they are the garden.\r\n\r\n            When I visited Chiswick House, a Palladian villa outside\r\nLondon, this winter, the garden beds in front of the 19 th century\r\nconservatory were all empty--just brown dirt against green grass. These beds,\r\nmade for the garish, summer displays of bright annuals popular in Victorian\r\nEngland, will shortly be filled with them again. But on the January day when I\r\nvisited, these beds revealed themselves as simple shapes, well-proportioned and\r\nwell-placed, making highly pleasing abstract patterns across the ground. We\r\nwould do well to consider our own garden beds, no matter how small, not just as\r\nholes where the flowers go but as things in themselves. Careful placement of\r\nour beds would ensure that they did not appear unsightly in winter, and more\r\nimportantly, that they create a satisfying grounding for the flowers to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n            This part\r\nof the Chiswick gardens was wrapped by a high wall and punctuated with urns. A\r\nflower bed or border is almost always more attractive with a backdrop or\r\nenclosure, such as a hedge or fence, to set it off. Even when empty, an\r\nenclosure immediately creates a garden.\r\n\r\n            \r\nOne of the most perfect garden rooms in our\r\ncountry, and perhaps the most simple, is at the Bloedel Reserve, formerly a\r\nprivate estate, on Bainbridge Island near Seattle. It consists of a\r\n10-foot-high clipped evergreen hedge bordering a large rectangular lawn.\r\nAnother large rectangle, a reflecting pool, is set into the lawn, level with\r\nthe grass. Pool, grass, and hedge form a rectangle in a rectangle in a\r\nrectangle. If you walk in through the surrounding woods, this overtly man-made\r\nenvironment will appear to you as a scene of sublime calmness. The woods are\r\nbrought into the garden through their reflection on the water. You're forced to\r\nsee the wild more clearly; you are made more aware of the trees than when you\r\nwere walking under them. The simple gesture, strongly articulated, is more\r\npowerful than any number of smaller ones. Come summer, this garden will hardly\r\nlook different from what it does now--a beautiful garden all of green, without\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n   \r\n"},"properties":[{"key":"SourceSystemId","values":["WM7C44P4T2U4.V42D4K6QZEKW1@mimefactory.state.tld"]},{"key":"Sender","values":["{\"Name\":null,\"Address\":\"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev\",\"RoutingType\":\"SMTP\",\"MailboxType\":\"Mailbox\",\"Id\":null}"]},{"key":"IngestedFromMailbox","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"BirthId","values":["5ac5d981-829b-4856-9628-ad30248c1d06"]},{"key":"SizeInKb","values":["10.957"]},{"key":"AttachmentCount","values":["0"]},{"key":"IsCapstone","values":["True"]},{"key":"Sensitivity","values":["Official"]},{"key":"SensitivityAssigned","values":["EnvironmentDefaultAssigned"]},{"key":"IsRecord","values":["True"]},{"key":"IsTransitory","values":["False"]},{"key":"Classification","values":[""]},{"key":"MetadataGenerated","values":["2017-11-08T13:46:01.2928023Z"]},{"key":"MetadataGeneratorVersion","values":["0.1.1107.1"]},{"key":"Source","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"SourceType","values":["EmailExchange"]},{"key":"DispositionType","values":["Capstone"]},{"key":"DispositionDate","values":["2042-11-06T23:57:20Z"]}],"security":{"securityDescriptors":["RECORD","OFFICIAL","CAPSTONE","eRecords"],"signatures":[]},"users":[{"userRoles":["From"],"id":122,"originalSmtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","smtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"firstName":"svcErecMbxPusher","userValidFrom":"2017-04-18T10:34:19.84","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\svcErecMbxPusher","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"svcErecMbxPusher","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7143","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":173,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb23Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb23Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":true,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-29T02:51:09.14","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb23Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"eRecJmb23Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7190","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"}]},"errata":[{"type":"Warning","task":"ParseJournal","field":"JournalReport","value":"","reason":"No Journal Reports for Email"}],"indexLocation":"email_capstone25yr_2017"}
