The reason for last week's fatal mood swing,\r\naccording to the Post ? \"[She] shot him dead in a jealous rage and then\r\nblew her brains out after he announced he was dumping her for another\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n            The other woman has not been universally confirmed. While\r\nthe Daily News of Los Angeles reported that Brynn read a note from her\r\nhusband implying that he wanted to end the marriage, the New York Daily\r\nNews quoted a friend who said the comedian told him only a few days earlier\r\nthat his marriage was \"better than ever.\" The publication also reports that\r\nHartman recently gave his wife the ultimate ill-advised 40 th\r\nbirthday present: a gun.\r\n\r\n            United Press International\r\nreports Hartman was murdered \"execution-style,\" with two shots to the head and\r\none to the chest, around 2 a.m. while he lay in bed. Shortly afterward Brynn\r\n(nee Vicki Omdahl) fled, leaving one or both of her young children, ages 9 and\r\n6, behind. She went to the home of an unidentified male friend, where she\r\nincoherently confessed to the murder. The friend did not believe her, but after\r\nshe fell asleep, he opened her purse and found a gun. They returned to her home\r\nearly in the morning, and while police were bringing the 6-year-old daughter\r\nout, Brynn locked herself in the bedroom and shot herself with another gun.\r\n\r\n            The\r\ndistraught families of the couple issued a joint statement that implied the\r\ntragedy was some sort of creation of the press. \"The unbridled speculation\r\noffered in the media are unfounded. Phil and Brynn were a loving couple,\r\ndevoted to each other and their children.\" Their will gives custody of the\r\nchildren to Brynn Hartman's sister.\r\n\r\n            \r\nAfter farewell tributes to Frank Sinatra last\r\nweek, this week the supermarket tabs turn to the gory aftermath: the escalating\r\nhatred between his children and his widow, Barbara. They have loathed each\r\nother for years, but the final break came, according to the Globe , when\r\nBarbara called Sinatra's publicist by cell phone to alert her that the dying\r\nSinatra was on his way to Cedars-Sinai hospital by ambulance, but did not call\r\nany of his three children to tell them the news. After the singer was\r\npronounced dead, a doctor called his daughter Tina. So just then you're ready\r\nto side with the kids, the Globe comes up with a twist. Daughter Nancy,\r\nit reports, has always been moved by the moment at JFK's funeral when John-John\r\nsaluted his dead father. The Globe reports Nancy told Barbara, \"I want\r\nto salute daddy.\" In order to do this the children wanted a \"massive,\r\nmilitary-style public funeral televised worldwide.\"\r\n\r\n            It turns out, according to\r\nthe National Enquirer , Nancy had already announced plans for a military\r\nhonor guard on her Web site, even though Sinatra had never been in the service.\r\nBarbara wanted a private funeral, with no military presence and no saluting.\r\nWhen the two daughters came to negotiate with Barbara (Frank Jr. just wants to\r\nbe kept out of it), according to the Enquirer \"the first thing Barbara\r\ndid was wave Frank's will in their faces--and say tauntingly, 'Good for me--bad\r\nfor you.' \" Barbara got her way, and she and Sinatra's children went to the\r\nfuneral in separate limos.\r\n\r\n            They are\r\neven feuding over the singer's final words, reports the Enquirer . Nancy\r\nclaims they were, \"I'm losing.\" But gossip columnist Cindy Adams says Barbara\r\ntold her they were \"I don't want to go ... I don't want to go ... I want to be\r\nhere for Christmas.\" (The Star reports Sinatra essentially died in his\r\nsleep and had no parting words.) Now, according to the Globe , Nancy is\r\nplanning a nasty tell-all book about her stepmother. The publication says Nancy\r\nhas declared, \"It's payback time.\"\r\n\r\n            It's a sentiment Sinatra at least would understand. In its\r\ntribute issue, the Star reports how the singer used to visit the Barbara\r\nSinatra Children's Center, the place his wife established for abused children.\r\nWhile there he was taken with a 7-year-old girl who, he found out, had been\r\nsexually abused by her father. So Sinatra got the father's name and address and\r\ndrove with his friend Jilly Rizzo to the man's house. Sinatra put the father in\r\na headlock and said if he ever abused the child again Sinatra would come back\r\nand kill him. Barbara tried to ban Frank from the center, and when he showed up\r\nanyway the staff would try to make sure he didn't see any of the parents there\r\nfor counseling.\r\n\r\n            Toward the\r\nend of his life Sinatra also found himself in a charitable mood over an old\r\nrival, Marlon Brando. Sinatra had seen some pictures of Brando and decided he\r\nneeded to talk to the obese actor about his weight. Sinatra called Brando and\r\ntold him he shouldn't let himself go. \"You look like f--ing hell, Brando,\" the\r\nStar reports he said, and he advised the actor to lose \"maybe a hundred\r\npounds, pallie.\" Brando replied by telling the singer to \"f-- off\" and hung up\r\non him. Sinatra then reportedly ripped the phone out of the wall and threw it\r\nacross the room. It's a scene Phil Hartman, as Sinatra, would have played so\r\nwell on Saturday Night Live .\r\n\r\n            \r\nM?tley Cr?e drummer Tommy Lee will have plenty\r\nof time to contemplate his temper as he serves his six month sentence for\r\nfelony spousal abuse of his wife, former Baywatch actress Pamela\r\nAnderson. According to the Enquirer Lee is in a single-person cell\r\nbecause, explains an \"insider,\" \"Nobody can beat up a goddess like Pamela\r\nAnderson without someone gunning for them.\" The publication also reports that\r\nAnderson plans to go ahead with her divorce and feels she can never forgive\r\nLee. More ominously, the Star reports that the actress is actually\r\nplanning to give him another chance and wants to try a second honeymoon after\r\nhe gets out of jail for assaulting her. The Enquirer also reports that\r\nshe is going to court to stop distribution of a home video of her having sex\r\nwith Tommy Lee, and another one of her having sex with an ex-boyfriend. (Pam,\r\nthrow away the tripod!)\r\n\r\n            Celebrity\r\nfree falls are rampant this month. Actor Charlie Sheen's latest accessory is an\r\nelectronic monitoring device, and he was ordered by a Malibu court to enter\r\ndrug treatment, according to the Associated Press. Sheen will then have a July\r\nhearing on whether he violated his probation--he pleaded no contest a year ago\r\nto attacking a girlfriend--by engaging in drug activity. Sheen recently\r\noverdosed on cocaine and methamphetamine, the 32-year-old actor's third\r\noverdose, according to the Star . A few months earlier, Sheen's father,\r\nactor Martin Sheen, and other family members tried to get Charlie to go to the\r\nPromises rehab center (where Brynn Hartman had reportedly been treated), but he\r\nrefused. And it reports that a friend says Sheen \"likes free-basing and he\r\nkeeps loaded guns in the house.\" Another source predicts if Sheen doesn't shape\r\nup, \"it's only a matter of time before they'll be printing his obituary.\"\r\n\r\n            For a year the tabs have been reporting on what the\r\nStar calls \"a string of bizarre incidents\" involving actress Farrah\r\nFawcett. From an erratic performance on the David Letterman show to a violent\r\nconfrontation with a boyfriend to the latest, her odd behavior at the Cannes\r\nFilm Festival. The recently face-lifted Fawcett was, according to the\r\nEnquirer , \"dazed and confused\" and \"giggly to the point of being silly\"\r\nat the festival, where she was promoting her latest film, The Apostle .\r\nThe Star reports she canceled a scheduled press conference and never\r\nshowed up at a party with the movie's star, Robert Duvall. It was worse, they\r\nsay, when she did make appearances. The publication quotes a \"film critic\" who\r\nsays at the post-screening interview she \"giggled uncontrollably ... and she\r\nwas talking gibberish.\" Fawcett's spokeswoman says the actress was suffering\r\nfrom food poisoning.\r\n\r\n            Even Euripides didn't write\r\nall bummers. So on a happy note, actor Jim Carrey and his ex-wife, actress\r\nLauren Holly, have been spotted shopping for a new set of wedding rings,\r\naccording to the Star . This must mean that what the Enquirer\r\ncalls their \"weird love pact\" is working. The couple has agreed to make love\r\nonly once a week, so Carrey can prove their relationship is not just about\r\nlust. And he has also agreed to stop making funny faces every time he passes a\r\nmirror, a habit that had \"frightened\" his now ex-wife, according to the\r\nEnquirer --but that also helped boost his salary to $20 million a\r\nmovie.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n   \r\n"},"properties":[{"key":"SourceSystemId","values":["CKRT43L5T2U4.0SHOHY32DB5T2@mimefactory.state.tld"]},{"key":"Sender","values":["{\"Name\":null,\"Address\":\"svcErecMbxPusher2@state.udev\",\"RoutingType\":\"SMTP\",\"MailboxType\":\"Mailbox\",\"Id\":null}"]},{"key":"IngestedFromMailbox","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"BirthId","values":["7b2244ce-6797-46a0-a73c-dd56965d6334"]},{"key":"SizeInKb","values":["18.700"]},{"key":"Sensitivity","values":["Official"]},{"key":"IsTransitory","values":["False"]},{"key":"SensitivityAssigned","values":["ClientAssigned"]},{"key":"AttachmentCount","values":["0"]},{"key":"IsCapstone","values":["False"]},{"key":"IsRecord","values":["True"]},{"key":"Classification","values":[""]},{"key":"MetadataGenerated","values":["2017-11-08T21:09:17.0522371Z"]},{"key":"MetadataGeneratorVersion","values":["0.1.1107.1"]},{"key":"Source","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"SourceType","values":["EmailExchange"]},{"key":"DispositionType","values":["Official"]},{"key":"DispositionDate","values":["2024-11-06T23:58:01Z"]}],"security":{"securityDescriptors":["RECORD","OFFICIAL","CA-BUREAU","eRecords"],"signatures":[]},"users":[{"userRoles":["To"],"id":156,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb5Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb5Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"isDomestic":true,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb5Recip1","bureauPK":10,"bureauCode":"CA","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","division":"CA","samAccountName":"eRecJmb5Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7154","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["From"],"id":201,"originalSmtp":"svcErecMbxPusher2@state.udev","smtp":"svcErecMbxPusher2@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-03-24T10:55:31.45","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\svcErecMbxPusher2","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"svcErecMbxPusher2","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7223","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"}]},"errata":[{"type":"Warning","task":"ParseJournal","field":"JournalReport","value":"","reason":"No Journal Reports for Email"},{"type":"Information","task":"ParseMime","field":"SensitivityAssigned","value":"","reason":"No Sensitivity Assigned Header"}],"indexLocation":"email_official7yr_2017_m11"}
