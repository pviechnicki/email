One is to read Whitewater\r\nIndependent Counsel Kenneth Starr's just-released report on the subject--a\r\nbriskly efficient 114-page document that makes an already overwhelming case for\r\nsuicide about as close to airtight as you can get. The other is to read\r\nChristopher Ruddy's new book, The Strange Death of Vincent Foster .\r\nRuddy, of course, is the Inspector Clouseau of the Foster case--a determined,\r\nif bumbling, former New York Post reporter who has virtually\r\nsingle-handedly spawned a cottage industry of conspiracy buffs dedicated to the\r\nproposition that a foul and monstrous cover-up surrounds the circumstances of\r\nFoster's death.\r\n\r\n            Financed by a cranky right-wing philanthropist, Richard\r\nMellon Scaife, Ruddy's repeated bromides about the Foster case have been\r\nrepublished in newspaper ads across the country; his sheer persistence has led\r\nsome casual observers to conclude he might be on to something. The Strange\r\nDeath , published by The Free Press, a division of Simon & Schuster, is\r\nendorsed as \"serious and compelling\" by former FBI Director William Sessions.\r\nIn the New York Times Book Review , National Review senior editor\r\nRichard Brookhiser chides political journalists for failing to pursue Ruddy's\r\nmany \"unanswered questions\" about the case.\r\n\r\n            Don't\r\nworry, when it comes to how Foster died, there aren't any--or none that matter.\r\nRuddy's book--and the entire movement he has helped create--is utterly\r\npreposterous. Turgidly written and dense with 534 footnotes and seven\r\nappendixes, Ruddy's plodding book repeatedly confuses the evidence and chases\r\nafter scores of imaginary holes in the official verdict--without ever positing\r\nan alternative scenario that makes the least bit of sense.\r\n\r\n            \r\nTo fully understand why the \"debate\" over\r\nFoster's death is so phony, it helps to review a few of the raw,\r\nincontrovertible (you would think) facts. Foster left his White House office\r\nfor the last time at around 1 p.m. on July 20, 1993. About five hours later,\r\nhis supine body was discovered by a secluded Civil War cannon near the Potomac\r\nRiver, a bullet wound through his mouth, his right thumb trapped in the trigger\r\nof an antique .38-caliber revolver, gun-shot residue on his hand, and blood\r\noozing from the back of his head. There were no signs of a struggle; his sports\r\njacket was later found folded over the front seat of his Honda Accord in a\r\nnearby parking lot. In the days that followed, friends and family members\r\ndescribed Foster as distraught over the demands of his job and suffering from\r\nclear signs of depression. Starr adds new details: Just four days before his\r\ndeath, he reports, Foster broke down in tears over dinner with his wife and\r\ntalked of resigning. On the day before he died he phoned his family doctor in\r\nLittle Rock, Ark. According to the doctor's typewritten notes, published in\r\nStarr's report for the first time, Foster complained of stress, anorexia, and\r\ninsomnia, and received a prescription for Desyrel, an antidepressant.\r\n\r\n            It is\r\nRuddy's contention that none of this should necessarily be believed; the\r\ndoctor, the widow, the friends, the Park Police officers that found the body,\r\nthe coroner who performed the autopsy--all may well be \"complicit\" in a\r\ncover-up. But why? As far as the Park Police goes, Ruddy argues, they\r\nmistakenly rushed to the judgment that Foster's death was a suicide and are\r\nconcealing the fact that they failed to follow proper police procedures by\r\nconsidering alternatives, such as murder and/or the possibility that Foster\r\ndied somewhere else and his body was \"moved\" to Fort Marcy by an unidentified\r\ngroup of secret conspirators. The argument begs certain questions, such as: Who\r\nwere these conspirators? What possible motive would they have had? Why deposit\r\nFoster's body in a public park? (At least the Mafia drops its victims in\r\nrivers.) And most curious of all, how exactly could this dastardly crime have\r\nbeen carried off? Consider: There were at least a half-dozen people known to\r\nhave visited the park that afternoon. It was broad daylight. Foster was 6 feet\r\n4 inches tall and weighed 200 pounds. To have transported the deputy White\r\nHouse counsel's lumpy dead body 200 yards from the parking lot to the cannon\r\nand have nobody notice would have been quite an achievement. Wouldn't they have\r\nat least waited until nightfall?\r\n\r\n            Ruddy makes no stab at guessing who the criminals are. But\r\nas he plows his way through hundreds of pages of witness statements, he thinks\r\nhe has discovered what they were wearing: orange vests! This is actually not a\r\njoke. Ruddy dwells ominously on the equivocal testimony of a Fairfax County\r\nrescue worker, Todd Hall, who initially told the police he thought he might\r\nhave seen someone in an orange or red vest in the woods. Hall later conceded it\r\nmay have been nothing more than a car or truck in the distance. Still, Ruddy\r\nsmells a rat. He speculates darkly that Hall's possible sighting was evidence\r\nof a suspicious group of orange-vest-clad body-movers in the park that day\r\nmasquerading as Park Police \"volunteers.\"\r\n\r\n            There is,\r\nof course, much more about Ruddy's book that is equally absurd--or simply\r\nwrong. Like his fellow conspiracy nuts, Ruddy argues that there was too little\r\nblood in Fort Marcy for Foster to have been killed there. In fact, as Starr\r\nmakes clear, when Foster's body was turned over, three Park Police officers\r\nreported a pool of blood underneath his head and new, wet blood pouring out of\r\nhis nose. The first independent counsel, Robert Fiske, is chastised for failing\r\nto identify supposedly mysterious white carpet fibers found on Foster's\r\nclothing. Starr has: The carpet fibers are the same as those found in Foster's\r\nhome. Ruddy and other critics have questioned where the .38-caliber revolver\r\nfound in Foster's hand came from. According to Starr's report, Foster's widow,\r\nsister, and two of his children recall that Foster inherited a similar handgun\r\nfrom his late father in 1991 and that he took it to Washington two years later,\r\nkeeping it in a bedroom closet. When Lisa Foster ran upstairs to look for it on\r\nthe night of her husband's death, the weapon was missing. Are they all\r\nlying?\r\n\r\n            \r\nIn the days before his death, Foster was\r\nobsessing about the White House travel-office affair, and apparently feared\r\ncontinued investigations would focus attention on Hillary Clinton's role in the\r\nfirings. That almost certainly helps to account for White House stonewalling\r\nover the documents left behind in his office--an action that did much to fuel\r\nsuspicions about what secrets Foster might have known. But that the man killed\r\nhimself is beyond dispute. It would be comforting to think that Starr's\r\nreport--reaching precisely the same conclusion as four previous government\r\ninvestigations--will finally end the matter. Of course, it won't. On his\r\ncontinually updated Web site, the indomitable Ruddy charges on, picking away at\r\nStarr's report and darkly suggesting that the Whitewater prosecutor, with his\r\nimpeccable Republican credentials, has joined the cover-up. It must be heady\r\nstuff taking on such giant conspiracies--and frightening too. Can Ruddy be sure\r\nthe men with orange vests won't soon be coming for him?\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
