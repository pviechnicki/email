Even better: He claims\r\nthat he doesn't like Americans, which makes him as good as French. As he opens\r\nthe door, I ask him if, in the three years he says he's lived here, he's come\r\nto know any of the French people in our building. He finds the question\r\namusing. \"I prefer to keep to myself,\" he explains. \"And so do they.\" Clearly,\r\nwe are the last thing he needs in his life: a bunch of eager Americans trying\r\nto shoehorn information out of him about how to invent a life in Paris.\r\n\r\n            In any\r\ncase, our new neighbor--Raskolnikov, I'll call him--is a reluctant source. His\r\nlong awkward silences are punctuated only by unsettling smiles and chilling\r\nanecdotes. We ask him if he knows where the nearest market is; he responds by\r\nasking us if we know why there is so much calcium in the Parisian water. We say\r\nwe didn't realize there was calcium in the Parisian water. He explains that it\r\ncomes from the bones of the people Napoleon dug up from the cemeteries and\r\nreburied under the city. We laugh. He smiles in his strange, unsettling way,\r\nand insists he is being serious. If we want to stay in Paris, we must be\r\nprepared to drink old French bones.\r\n\r\n            In\r\nflat tones, Raskolnikov quickly explains to my wife the perils of our new home.\r\nThe old woman next door who leaves on her gas burners, and who will one day, he\r\ninsists, blow us all to bits, is just the start of it. There is also the French\r\nhandyman who does the work on our side of the building. \"French handyman\"\r\nstrikes my American ears as oxymoronically as \"American intellectual\" probably\r\nstrikes French ones. But they do exist; ours is named M. Gautier. A few months\r\nago M. Gautier installed new lights in Raskolnikov's room. Not long after he'd\r\nfinished, Raskolnikov began to receive electrical shocks while taking his bath.\r\nM. Gautier had grounded the wires into the tub.\r\n\r\n            \r\nRaskolnikov now pulls his hand from his pea coat. It is one giant black bruise.\r\nA heater installed by M. Gautier had exploded a few nights earlier and fired a\r\nbolt like a bullet across the room and into Raskolnikov's hand. \"I won't let\r\nGautier into my place again,\" says Raskolnikov. \"If I were you, I wouldn't\r\neither. He'll kill you.\"\r\n\r\n            When\r\nRaskolnikov leaves, Tabitha wrinkles her nose and says, \"I don't like it when I\r\ndon't know whether people are joking.\"\r\n\r\n            \r\nDiscomfort. Disorientation. Anomie. Whatever you call it, that is the sensation\r\noffered to us by Paris these first few weeks. Clearly, we don't belong here. We\r\nprove it many times each day. Our simplest activities somehow become pitched\r\nbattles against an entire culture. Walking the streets, for instance. Parisian\r\nsidewalks are obstacle courses of dog shit. To make the game of avoiding the\r\ndog shit really interesting, the locals turn it into a competitive sport. They\r\ncome at you in packs and refuse to yield ground, even when they clearly lack\r\nthe right of way. If you want to get anywhere on foot you have to at once leap\r\nover the dog shit and burst heroically through oncoming hordes of French\r\npeople. Red Rover, Red Rover, send Henri-Antoine right over!\r\n\r\n            Here\r\nwe have next to no ability to determine what is normal and what is noteworthy.\r\nTake the famous storms. They struck three days after we arrived, without\r\nwarning, at least to us. Around 2 in the morning, our house began to shake. The\r\nwindows rattled madly. When I got out of bed to have a look outside, I found a\r\nscene from the early part of The Wizard of Oz : plastic garden chairs\r\nswirling in the air, huge planting pots crashing over, medium-size trees bent\r\nnearly in two. I went back to bed, assuming that it must be just a typical\r\nParisian winter night. The next morning, we awakened to find huge trees in the\r\nstreet, shattered glass on the sidewalks, and cafe awnings ripped in two. We\r\nstepped over all of it without giving it much thought. Oh, that French weather!\r\nC'est fou! It was not until we found a row of old men peering through\r\nthe bars of the Luxembourg Gardens, mourning the death of their favorite old\r\ntrees, that we realized something was afoot. The highest winds in recorded\r\nhistory had swept through Paris, and for us it was just another night. Such is\r\nthe curiously disoriented mentality of the newcomer. It's childhood all over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n            To my\r\nwife, Paris is a problem to be solved. She's always been one of those people\r\nwho believe firmly in reading the instructions before assembly. For the past\r\ntwo months, she's been poring over one or the other of our nine books on how to\r\nget along with the French, from which she passes on to me the occasional tip.\r\nFor a while, I dismissed these with an almost Gallic aloofness. Finally, she\r\nbecame so insistent that I picked up one of the books. French or Foe , it\r\nwas called. Sure enough, it was filled with advice: Don't smile randomly. Avoid\r\nbeing likable. When a French person says \"Everyone likes him,\" what he really\r\nmeans is \"He's a failure.\" If you must cross your legs, do it carefully, as a\r\nwoman does who is wearing a short skirt, not sloppily, like a golfer at the\r\n19 th hole. Never bring wine or flowers to a French dinner party. If\r\nyou do bring flowers, make sure they are not yellow flowers, as a yellow flower\r\nis the signal from a French guest to a French hostess that her husband is\r\ncheating on her. (Subtle!) Above all, never use the toilet when you are out to\r\ndinner. You might think that by now every Frenchman understands that foreigners\r\npee when they need to and will not think them barbarians for doing so. Not so,\r\napparently.\r\n\r\n            On and\r\non it went. The general drift of the advice was that, with one exception, if\r\nyou wanted to get what you wanted in France, you must exchange your American\r\nwarmth and directness for a cool and aloof manner. The exception was if you\r\nwanted to have sex. They do that here, too, apparently. A long section of the\r\nbook was devoted to the sexually charged nature of French public life. The\r\nauthor explains that you can't walk down the streets of Paris without stirring\r\nup vital juices all around you. For instance, all polite Frenchmen give the\r\nwomen they approve of what the author calls \"The Look.\" The author describes\r\nThe Look thusly: \"The Look from a stranger, maybe passing her on the street or\r\nin a car, of an unmistakable intensity that lets her know that for that man,\r\nshe's got it.\"\r\n\r\n            I put\r\ndown the book and tell Tabitha about The Look. It probably won't come naturally\r\nto an American male, but, in an attempt to enter into the spirit of French\r\ndaily life, I will cultivate a Look of my own. \"I will practice The Look on old\r\nFrench ladies who are happy to have any old look at all,\" I say, \"and then, as\r\nI get the hang of it, move gradually into the big leagues.\"\r\n\r\n            This\r\nirritates her immensely. \"Out of that whole book,\" she says, \"all you came away\r\nwith is The Look?\"\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n   \r\n"},"properties":[{"key":"SourceSystemId","values":["GIBXSRU5T2U4.JYT73OV4ML553@mimefactory.state.tld"]},{"key":"Sender","values":["{\"Name\":null,\"Address\":\"svcErecMbxPusher2@state.udev\",\"RoutingType\":\"SMTP\",\"MailboxType\":\"Mailbox\",\"Id\":null}"]},{"key":"IngestedFromMailbox","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"BirthId","values":["8af4149e-550a-4e56-be81-c67bf906316a"]},{"key":"SizeInKb","values":["15.011"]},{"key":"Sensitivity","values":["Official"]},{"key":"IsTransitory","values":["False"]},{"key":"SensitivityAssigned","values":["ClientAssigned"]},{"key":"AttachmentCount","values":["0"]},{"key":"IsCapstone","values":["False"]},{"key":"IsRecord","values":["True"]},{"key":"Classification","values":[""]},{"key":"MetadataGenerated","values":["2017-11-08T23:07:25.4852855Z"]},{"key":"MetadataGeneratorVersion","values":["0.1.1108.2"]},{"key":"Source","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"SourceType","values":["EmailExchange"]},{"key":"DispositionType","values":["Official"]},{"key":"DispositionDate","values":["2024-11-06T23:59:28Z"]}],"security":{"securityDescriptors":["RECORD","OFFICIAL","eRecords"],"signatures":[]},"users":[{"userRoles":["To"],"id":129,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb26Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb26Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb26Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise
