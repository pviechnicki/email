The narration implies that the reason kids are\r\nusing drugs is that we're not tough on pushers, who get just \"a slap on the\r\nwrist.\" Valid or not, the view mirrors opinion polls. The language of the ad is\r\npretested, and this initial argument will encounter little voter resistance. A\r\nsubsequent image--a slow fade on a group of schoolkids, an American flag behind\r\nthem--is a powerful one. It tells us visually that the America we want is\r\nfading away.\r\n\r\n            Next, we see the Good\r\nGuy--Phil Gramm. He's depicted in a photograph, not on film. During the\r\npresidential primaries, ad tests showed that voters reacted negatively to Gramm\r\nspeaking. So here he is, smiling, but in the safety of a still image. A shot of\r\na congressional bill and a blowup quote provide symbolic third-party\r\nverification that the senator \"has a plan\" to get tough on pushers. Gramm's\r\npicture promptly disappears, but its brief presence qualifies the ad for the\r\nmore lenient federal rules about \"candidate\" spots: Such spots can't be\r\ncensored, and the stations must sell the time at a lower \"political\" rate.\r\n\r\n            Gramm maintains a presence\r\nin the spot via a chyron (text on the screen): \"The Gramm Plan.\" This plan\r\nconsists, in part, of a 10-year sentence with no parole for pushers--another\r\npretested winner in polls. The second element of the plan--life sentences for\r\npushers who \"exploit\" kids--strikes another responsive chord by raising the\r\nspecter of molestation. The Gramm Plan is accompanied by color film of\r\nprisoners behind bars. Why color? Because in this spot, putting more offenders\r\nin jail is a happy result.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               The News now cuts to\r\na film clip of Morales, a schoolteacher who won a stunning upset victory in the\r\nDemocratic primary. The clip cleverly gives the impression that Morales is\r\nactually saying what's written on screen and sourced to a local paper: that he\r\nopposes longer sentences as a deterrent against crime. The spot nails him as an\r\nopponent of Gramm's get-tough approach, as a liberal softy. The red background\r\ncomplements the negative text and images.\r\n\r\n            Ironically, the spot\r\nconcludes by riffing on the slogan long used by liberal Sen. Howard Metzenbaum\r\nand adopted by Michael Dukakis in 1988: \"Who's on your side?\" The strategy\r\nhere: to invite voters to judge on the basis of social, not economic,\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               The News attempts to\r\nset the campaign agenda. How can the underfunded Morales expect to raise issues\r\nsuch as Medicare, jobs, or education in his spots when he's tied down defending\r\nhimself against the Gramm blitz?\r\n\r\n            \r\n               The\r\nNews echoes and reinforces the message in Bob Dole's ads and speeches:\r\nDemocrats are weak on drugs. No accident there: The News was produced by\r\nAlex Castellanos, one of the new members of Dole's media team.\r\n\r\n            --Robert\r\nShrum\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n   \r\n"},"properties":[{"key":"SourceSystemId","values":["RSC47FE6T2U4.MRL6UWVTWX1M1@mimefactory.state.tld"]},{"key":"Sender","values":["{\"Name\":null,\"Address\":\"svcErecMbxPusher2@state.udev\",\"RoutingType\":\"SMTP\",\"MailboxType\":\"Mailbox\",\"Id\":null}"]},{"key":"IngestedFromMailbox","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"BirthId","values":["8a926b87-e60b-49ee-9788-3e108b3c66c7"]},{"key":"SizeInKb","values":["7.537"]},{"key":"Sensitivity","values":["Official"]},{"key":"IsTransitory","values":["False"]},{"key":"SensitivityAssigned","values":["ClientAssigned"]},{"key":"AttachmentCount","values":["0"]},{"key":"IsCapstone","values":["False"]},{"key":"IsRecord","values":["True"]},{"key":"Classification","values":[""]},{"key":"MetadataGenerated","values":["2017-11-09T02:16:12.2947591Z"]},{"key":"MetadataGeneratorVersion","values":["0.1.1108.2"]},{"key":"Source","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"SourceType","values":["EmailExchange"]},{"key":"DispositionType","values":["Official"]},{"key":"DispositionDate","values":["2024-11-06T23:56:16Z"]}],"security":{"securityDescriptors":["RECORD","OFFICIAL","eRecords"],"signatures":[]},"users":[{"userRoles":["To"],"id":181,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb20Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb20Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb20Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"eRecJmb20Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7184","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["From"],"id":201,"originalSmtp":"svcErecMbxPusher2@state.udev","smtp":"svcErecMbxPusher2@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-03-24T10:55:31.45","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\svcErecMbxPusher2","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"svcErecMbxPusher2","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7223","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"}]},"errata":[{"type":"Warning","task":"ParseJournal","field":"JournalReport","value":"","reason":"No Journal Reports for Email"},{"type":"Information","task":"ParseMime","field":"SensitivityAssigned","value":"","reason":"No Sensitivity Assigned Header"}],"indexLocation":"email_official7yr_2017_m11"}
