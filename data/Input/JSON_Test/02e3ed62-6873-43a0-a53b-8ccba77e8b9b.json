Everyone\r\n(especially Brent Curtis) knows what Harry Lime says in The Third Man :\r\n\"In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and\r\nbloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the\r\nRenaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love--they had 500 years of\r\ndemocracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.\"\r\n\r\n            Second, they're a refuge, said Tom Stoppard, in\r\nTravesties --Zurich, World War I, home to Lenin, Joyce, and Tzara: \"Oh,\r\nSwitzerland!--unfurled like a white flag, pacific civilian Switzerland--the\r\nmiraculous neutrality of it, the non-combatant impartiality of it, the\r\nnon-aggression pacts of it, the international red cross of it--entente to the\r\nleft, d?tente to the right, into the valley of the invalided blundered and\r\nwandered myself when young--Carr of the Consulate!\"\r\n\r\n            Of course Carr was quite dotty, and neutral does\r\nnot mean pacific, as John McPhee makes clear in La Place de la Concorde\r\nSuisse , his book on the Swiss army, our third bit of alpine lore: Their\r\narmed neutrality includes universal military training. Every family has a gun,\r\nand none of your sissy American pistols; these are assault rifles. The Israeli\r\ndefense forces are based on the Swiss model, the hedgehog, designed to extract\r\na high price from any invader--artillery presighted on every important bridge,\r\nshelter space for every citizen and cow, cool Saab fighter planes whose pilots\r\ntrain to take off from highways.\r\n\r\n            Four things--those\r\nred-handled multi-blade ... five ... five things--the Swatch. And the sixth\r\nthing we know--the Alps. Numbered bank accounts would be seven.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Neutral\r\nAnswer\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The Swiss want to make sure people coming in are\r\nnot abusing the law.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            More than 70 percent of Swiss voters approved\r\ntougher rules restricting asylum-seekers and rejected a proposal for maternity\r\nleave, presumably concerned that some incoming baby might abuse the law.\r\n\r\n            The new law limits refugees' rights to appeal\r\nindividual persecution, and it speeds up the process of ejecting those without\r\nidentity papers.\r\n\r\n            Although Swiss law requires new mothers to take an\r\neight-week leave, the Swiss have rejected financial assistance for mothers four\r\ntimes since the maternity leave law was enacted in 1945.\r\n\r\n            Levrat works for an\r\norganization called Aid to Refugees.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Gina Duclayan's\r\nDissent\r\n            \r\n\r\n            I beg to differ, Randy!\r\nOne of the favorite movies of my youth, a Tony Randall and Richard Dreyfus\r\nvehicle called Sub a Dub Dub , a k a Hello Down There , features\r\nthe amusing antics of a researcher and his family and friends in their undersea\r\nlab-home. Or perhaps you consider this movie to be evidence for your statement,\r\nnot against it? Pshaw!\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Matthew Singer's\r\nSavvy Traveler\r\n            \r\n\r\n            You will recall that\r\nJohn Calvin, the granddaddy of fundamentalist Protestant preachers, founded his\r\ntheocracy in Geneva, Switzerland. This has left more of a mark than you might\r\nexpect. A North American friend of mine was driving from Lyon to Geneva. A few\r\nmiles after he crossed the border, his little boy asked, \"Dad, what happened to\r\nall of the billboards with naked ladies on them?\" It was an acute observation:\r\nThe prudish Swiss countryside did indeed lack for any of the casual skin that\r\ncovers France.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Misplaced\r\nModifiers Extra\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Which of these\r\nadjectives appear in a New York Times piece describing George W.
