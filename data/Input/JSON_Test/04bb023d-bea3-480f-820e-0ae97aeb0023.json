E-mail is still not quite a universal medium when a\r\nuser who has been online for 18 years and writes a column for a Web magazine\r\ncan't open a binary attachment. Eventually a small, dim light bulb illuminated\r\nabove my head, and I simply went to the \r\n                  Slate\r\n                Web site--where, of\r\ncourse, your posting was waiting.\r\n\r\n            I had a real problem with The Best Man , and maybe this is the best\r\nplace to talk about it. I went to see it at Toronto, and found it static and\r\ntalky. I left after an hour, because I had another screening next door I\r\nhad to attend, and because I thought perhaps on a fresh day, freed from\r\nthe back-to-back festival screening routine, it might look different. On a\r\nsecond viewing back in Chicago, it did not, and I passed it to another\r\nSun-Times critic, just to give it another shot.\r\n\r\n            I thought The Best Man was similar to, and inferior to, The\r\nWood , which came out in July and was also a movie about high-school friends\r\nhaving a reunion at a wedding. The Wood had many of the same qualities\r\nof The Best Man , but more life and spirit, and it knew a lot more about\r\nhow to use a camera instead of lining up the characters for prolonged\r\nheart-to-hearts.\r\n\r\n            I know what you mean about the Michael Clarke Duncan character in The\r\nGreen Mile . His function is essentially to absorb and process white pain,\r\nsuffering, disease, and guilt, which he does visibly--which is a novel change\r\nfrom the decades of films in which black characters have done the same thing\r\ninvisibly (is there much difference between what Duncan does for Hanks here and\r\nwhat Poitier did for Steiger in In the Heat of the Night ?). I also\r\nwondered whether a Louisiana death row would have been integrated in 1935, and\r\nwhether all but one of its guards would have been so decent and humane.\r\n\r\n            On the other hand, I wonder whether African-American characters (and actors)\r\nshould be subjected to the kind of unspoken test that no white actor or\r\ncharacter ever has to face. No one ever asks whether a white actor, as a white\r\nactor, should have played a given role. And if John Coffey had been played by a\r\nwhite giant like Ron Perlman, for example, character and race would have gone\r\nunremarked.\r\n\r\n            I remember Morgan Freeman's regret as he told me that the recent role he\r\nmost wanted was Hannibal Lecter--\"but of course they couldn't let a black man\r\nplay a villain like that.\" Since Freeman is one of the few actors I can think\r\nof who might have equaled or improved on Anthony Hopkins' performance, I share\r\nhis regret that for no-doubt pious liberal reasons a black actor could not be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n            This just in: The African-American actor Harry J. Lennix does a superb job\r\nof playing Aaron, the arch-villain in Titus , although Anthony Hopkins,\r\nof course, gets to bake Tamora's sons into two meat pies.\r\n\r\n            Best,\r\nRoger\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
