But isn't this ubiquitous propagandizing what we mocked and derided when\r\nthe Soviets did it? (And by \"we,\" I of course mean, me, George Orwell, and the\r\ngang up at Chiatt Day.) Perhaps this was a subversive act, the\r\nurinal-drain-guard manufacturer inviting us to piss on the United States'\r\nfailed drug policy. Is that still a legal form of protest? Like Supreme Court\r\nJustice Kennedy, I have only a tenuous grasp of constitutional law, but won't\r\nthis sort of thing be taboo once that flag-burning amendment passes?\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Articles of\r\nConfederation Answer\r\n            \r\n\r\n            This is the legal underpinning of Justice Anthony\r\nKennedy's nostalgic embrace of states' rights.\r\n\r\n            Writing the decision in the first of three 5-4\r\ncases that undermine the rights of the individual to defend himself against a\r\nstate government, Kennedy argued that when a state violates a federal law, the\r\nfederal government can sue, but the individual victim cannot. \"Our federalism\r\nrequires that Congress treat the states in a manner consistent with their\r\nstatus as residuary sovereigns,\" he wrote, with a quill pen dipped in the blood\r\nof Thomas Jefferson, or maybe it was a word processor.\r\n\r\n            Writing the dissent,\r\nJustice David Souter argued that this goofball invocation of states rights (Was\r\nit \"goofball\"? No one has decent penmanship anymore.) leaves the individual\r\nwith little recourse when he's been wronged by sovereign Albany or that bastion\r\nof liberty, Harrisburg. Quoting Chief Justice John Marshall, Souter wrote: \"If\r\nhe has a right, and that right has been violated, do the laws of his country\r\nafford him a remedy? The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in\r\nthe right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws when he\r\nreceives an injury.\"\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Greg Diamond's\r\nCast Masters Extra:\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Participants were\r\ninvited to deflate the AFI's Greatest\r\nLegends List of movie stars by devising a brief plot summary of a movie in\r\nwhich any equally ranked pair--for instance Charlie Chaplin and Joan Crawford\r\nare both rated No. 10--should have co-starred.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               No. 7 It Happened Every Night for a Week --Velvet (Elizabeth\r\nTaylor) runs away from jealous father and must accept the help of a horse named\r\nPie (Clark Gable), really an out-of-work reporter looking for a big story.\r\nEither Velvet trains him for the Grand National, or he'll tell Velvet's\r\nfather.-- Eric Nelson\r\n               \r\n\r\n               No. 8 White Sheet --A self-taught nightrider (James Cagney)\r\nseeks increased stature by literally dancing on the shoulders of his Jewish\r\nlandlady (Judy Garland).
