Linux will do my homework, my dishes, my laundry. The hype reminds me of\r\nsimilar hype a couple of years ago about Java, which never did floss my teeth.\r\nBut, setting out to demystify Linux, I fell in love. Geek love, I hasten to\r\nadd. It's not for everyone.\r\n\r\n            Unlike Windows (and\r\nIBM's OS/2 and Apple's MacOS) Linux was written by a person, not a faceless\r\nmonolith like the company I work for. This person was Linus Torvalds. Linux is\r\nalso different because it is based on the founding principles and software of\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, whose name describes its mission. Linux is\r\nderived from an operating system developed by FSF called GNU. The proper name\r\nfor Linux is GNU/Linux. GNU is a variation on the Unix operating system and the\r\nacronym GNU stands--disconcertingly--for \" GNU's not Unix.\" Are you still with\r\nme?\r\n\r\n            The FSF crew preaches that all software should be \"Open\r\nSource,\" by which they mean that any user should be able to view and change the\r\nunderlying code, be it for the operating system or for applications.\r\n(Microsoft, Apple, and other companies consider their code top secret.) Open\r\nsourcers also advocate free distribution of software. To the FSF the issues of\r\nfree software are at the very foundation of creating a \"cooperative society.\" I\r\nam a wee bit skeptical. I enjoy getting paid to write software, and I suspect\r\nthat many, if not most, Linux enthusiasts are being paid by someone to write\r\nsoftware. It's nice that they can play with Linux for free, but if all software\r\nwere free, how would they eat?\r\n\r\n            When pushed, the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation defines \"free\" as a matter of liberty, not of price. Many\r\npeople pay for GNU/Linux, but the underlying mechanics are freely available to\r\nanyone who wants them. Companies that sell Linux offer the support and\r\nmaintenance that people have come to expect--and charge for them.\r\n\r\n            But software development religions aside, what is an\r\noperating system like Linux doing? As the name suggests, it controls the\r\nfundamental operation of your computer: things like how to read documents from\r\na disk and send them to a printer. As you may have heard, the demarcation of\r\nwhat is and isn't \"in the operating system\" can be a touchy question. Some\r\ncompanies maintain that an operating system contains any goddamn thing they\r\nwant to put in it, thank you very much. Other folks say that an operating\r\nsystem is just the core functionality (or in computer parlance, the kernel)\r\nnecessary to run the chips in your machine.\r\n\r\n            Linux is definitely the\r\nsecond model. When you turn on a computer using Linux you get no bells,\r\nwhistles, or windows. You just see some lines of text and then a blinking\r\ncursor. So are we just back to DOS? Well, no: You can add a graphical interface\r\nknown as Xwindows, which looks amazingly like Windows, complete with a Start\r\nbutton. Once you start Xwindows, you're back in familiar territory. You can use\r\nyour mouse to open documents and applications (such as WordPerfect). I even ran\r\na Web browser. A big practical disadvantage of Linux is that there isn't much\r\napplication software for it. But that's because so few people use it. It\r\nwouldn't be fair to count this as a negative in weighing Linux's intrinsic\r\nmerits. And so, of course, I won't.\r\n\r\n            To begin my experiment I had to get a machine running\r\nLinux. So I started searching the Web for information. After getting lost on a\r\nfew Web sites, I completely wimped out and went to Barnes & Noble. The\r\nsoftware may be free, but there's big money in books on how to use it. I made a\r\nscientific decision based on weight and purchased Red Hat Linux Secrets\r\nfor $39.95, which included Red Hat software's 5.1 version of Linux on a\r\nCD-ROM.\r\n\r\n            Back at the office I did\r\nthe hard stuff. I hijacked a Pentium 133 with 32 megs of memory and\r\nrepartitioned its hard drive into two parts. \"Repartitioned\" is a fancy way of\r\nsaying \"divided.\" Thus, instead of one big hard drive I now have two little\r\nones using the same physical disk. Linux has a utility program that helped me\r\ndo this (because it knows you're going to want to keep running Windows too). It\r\ndid involve some complicated thinking about disk cylinders, but it worked.\r\n\r\n            I then fruitlessly tried to get Linux to boot up. First I\r\ntried to get it to load directly from the CD that came with the book. Then I\r\nspent another hour trying to get the Linux boot disk I had created to\r\nacknowledge the existence of the CD drive. Finally, I copied the entire CD onto\r\nmy hard drive and started the install process. I had to create two more floppy\r\nboot disks.\r\n\r\n            I had to repartition my\r\ndrive again within Linux to create swap space for the operating system (for\r\nthose keeping track I now have three partitions on my hard drive). I had to\r\nformat both drives. I then had to remember where on my hard drive I had put the\r\ninstall files. Then it got started. Linux found my various devices, such as my\r\nmouse and graphics card. It configured both relatively painlessly. It wasn't\r\ncomplete plug and pray. I still had to select my items from lists, and it was\r\ngood that I generally knew what types of hardware I was running, but it worked.\r\nFinally I got a blinking cursor at the Linux prompt. I then launched Xwindows.\r\nTo complete the setup, I got the browser configured and read\r\n\r\n                  Slate\r\n               ! After installing Corel's WordPerfect I was even able to\r\nwrite this column on Linux in Linux. (Lexicographical curiosity: The word Linux\r\nis in the WordPerfect spell-check dictionary but not in Microsoft Word's.)\r\n\r\n            After spending a day with Linux, I concluded that it runs\r\ngreat. It helped that I know Unix, but the system does work. I have basic Web\r\nbrowsing capabilities and a word processor. I also configured and set up the\r\nWeb server, so I could, in theory, power all of \r\n                  Slate\r\n                off this\r\nmachine. In fact, Linux is definitely cool as a server. But if you want to\r\nreplace your desktop machine, forget it.\r\n\r\n            What makes Linux\r\nenthralling from a tech-head's point of view is that it is based on Unix\r\nstandards that have been around for decades. Companies from AT&T to Sun\r\nMicrosystems to Apple to IBM to Silicon Graphics have produced varieties of\r\nUnix for their business customers. While these varieties are generally\r\nincompatible with one another, all this code-writing has resulted in a\r\nfar-flung community that understands the Unix beast. Linux developers stand on\r\nthe shoulders of these giants, thus Linux has a lot of intrinsic testing behind\r\nit. That makes it what techies call \"robust,\" meaning resistant to breaking\r\ndown. Enthusiasts claim that Linux can run for years without requiring you to\r\nrestart your system. On my machine I can claim only a week of running without\r\nrestarting, but that is pretty darn good. It also has a solid multithreading\r\nand multitasking model, meaning that one errant program can't bring the whole\r\ncomputer to its knees. (This is a feature Linux shares with Windows NT, but not\r\nwith Windows 95/98.)\r\n\r\n            In terms of performance, Linux ran about as quickly as\r\nWindows 95/98 (though much faster than Windows NT Server) on my low-end Pentium\r\nmachine. For a completely unscientific example, there was little difference in\r\nbasic file operations such as copying and pasting, and WordPerfect ran just as\r\nfast as it did on a comparable Windows machine.\r\n\r\n            Should you switch to\r\nLinux? In my opinion, if you are a typical computer user, there is no practical\r\nreason to do so. The best reason is psychological. Linux is a workable\r\nalternative to Windows, and thus it allows you to vote with your PC. If you\r\nhate Microsoft, you can use Linux. It has all the basics necessary to get you\r\nthrough your computing life, if you are willing to ignore some rough edges here\r\nand there. For instance, you won't have much trouble importing data from word\r\nprocessing and spreadsheet files. But if you crave a huge variety of software\r\napplication--games, personal information managers, graphics programs, financial\r\nsoftware, reference works--you'd be better off buying a Mac or a Windows PC.\r\nSome experts predict that the dawning of the Web means that your operating\r\nsystem may be less and less important anyway. Many of you have used Linux and\r\ndon't even know it, because many of the Web sites you frequent to check the\r\nweather or buy airplane tickets are powered by Linux.\r\n\r\n            Now I must confess my doubts about the Open Source\r\nmovement. Do all those software developers writing open source code for Linux\r\nhave the incentive to fix problems as they arise and--more important--to help\r\npeople upgrade and keep old code running? Perhaps the greatest technological\r\nfeature that Windows possesses is that it can handle programs as old as the\r\nfirst DOS applications. Linux will never do that.\r\n\r\n            Some critics say that\r\nLinux will fracture into a dozen different incompatible versions, just as Unix\r\ndid. Linux champions insists that the community will prevent such a Tower of\r\nBabel disaster. I suspect that a schism will eventually divide the happy Linux\r\ncommunity, as equally creative innovators disagree on the operating system's\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n            Furthermore, as in \r\n                  Slate\r\n               , software companies\r\nspend a surprising fraction of their resources testing software, not writing\r\nit. In my experience, this is the ultimate problem with Open Source\r\ndevelopment: not enough formal engaged testing. Developers want to write code,\r\nthey don't want to solve all the niggling little problems that users come up\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n            But if the thought of a free operating system is so\r\nexciting that you're willing to pay $39.95 and invest hours for the privilege,\r\nby all means give Linux a try.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n
