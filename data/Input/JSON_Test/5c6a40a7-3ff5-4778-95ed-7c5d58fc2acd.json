The rays of the tropical sun here can\r\n        cause serious trouble. In no more than 15 to 20 minutes, fair skin can\r\n        be painfully broiled, even in the shade of a coconut tree. For the\r\n        first few days you?d be well advised to take the sun in extremely small\r\n        doses.\r\n        Swimming\r\n        Coral or volcanic, eggshell white or ashy gray, the sand of\r\n        FWI beaches varies from cove to cove. Your hotel may be on an\r\n        outstanding beach. If not, there?s usually one within easy reach. In\r\n        Guadeloupe, the best beaches are on Grande-Terre, as are most of the\r\n        hotels. Basse-Terre features both dark volcanic sand in the region of\r\n        La Soufri?re and beige beaches in the north. Local lore says that you\r\n        tan better on black sand.\r\n        Martinique?s Mount Pel?e provides the dark coloring for its\r\n        northern beaches. Saint-Martin and Saint-Barth?lemy, though also\r\n        volcanic in formation but without erupting peaks, have only light sand\r\n        beaches.\r\n        Swimming conditions vary enormously on all the islands.\r\n        You?ll have no trouble in identifying the many perfectly safe,\r\n        protected shores where hardly a ripple disturbs the surface. Otherwise,\r\n        there are some beaches or sections of beaches where swimming is less\r\n        recommended or even dangerous for all except experts. Coral reefs often\r\n        reduce wave strength but may not stem very strong ocean currents,\r\n        particularly in the Atlantic. Time of year is also a factor, the winter\r\n        months bringing heavier seas. On Martinique the Tourist Office advises\r\n        that the safest beaches for poor swimmers are at Sainte-Anne,\r\n        Trois-Ilets, Sainte-Luce, Trinit?, and Carbet.\r\n        Good tidings about the shark situation: no incident\r\n        involving a swimmer, snorkeler, or diver has been reported anywhere in\r\n        the FWI. Guadeloupe, incredibly, almost never sees a shark anywhere\r\n        near its coast. Sightings close to Martinique are very rare and not\r\n        much more frequent off the northern FWI. Nonetheless, swimming after\r\n        dusk is not advisable.\r\n        For a small fee, non-guests may use the beach and facilities\r\n        at a number of Guadeloupe and Martinique hotels?a great convenience for\r\n        island-hoppers. Alternatively, there are also fine public beaches, and\r\n        they?re often deserted.\r\n        Many hotels have swimming pools, for those who may be\r\n        allergic to sand.\r\n        Snorkeling, Skin Diving, Scuba Diving\r\n        Underwater sports off the major islands and rocky islets of\r\n        the FWI are the highlights of countless vacations. Snorkeling equipment\r\n        may be provided free, rented, or bought inexpensively in tourist areas,\r\n        so there?s no need to bring any from home. Beginners who can stay\r\n        afloat can learn to breathe through the tube and peer through the mask\r\n        in minutes.\r\n        Many of the best snorkeling and underwater photography\r\n        areas are offshore at coral reefs or around uninhabited islands; you?ll\r\n        have little difficulty in finding a boat to take you out. Such\r\n        multicolored reef dwellers as the parrotfish and French angelfish,\r\n        along with weirdly shaped coral, crawfish, or turtles hiding in\r\n        crevices, can be yours for the viewing in these clear waters where\r\n        visibility of 30 m (100 ft) is common.\r\n        Free-dive spear fishing (without air container) is\r\n        permitted in the FWI, but always check with local fishermen before\r\n        eating anything you catch (see page 117). You should see many of the\r\n        following: grouper, amberjack, red or rock hind, stingrays, Atlantic\r\n        rays, and moray eels. Equipment may be rented at watersports\r\n        establishments.\r\n        Scuba (an acronym for Self-Contained Underwater Breathing\r\n        Apparatus) is taught and offered at major hotels. This ultimate\r\n        subsurface experience is becoming very popular in France, as it has\r\n        been for a number of years in the United States. The Caribbean?s\r\n        transparency and teeming underwater life make it ideal for scuba, and\r\n        since the water stays tropically warm year-round you shouldn?t need a\r\n        full wetsuit.\r\n        Boating, Windsurfing, and Water-Skiing\r\n        A large number of hotels in the FWI have small boats\r\n        available for rent, including the always popular Sunfish. You can also\r\n        find instructors to give sailing lessons, as well as all kinds of boat\r\n        excursions on which a skipper and crew do the work while you relax.\r\n        Windsurfing is making a splash in the FWI: you?ll see the\r\n        colorful sails, boards, and masts all around the islands. It looks\r\n        easier than it is: you?ll need lessons, at least two or three, just to\r\n        get you started.\r\n        Water-skiing is somewhat harder to find, but certain hotels\r\n        do provide motorboats and skis with fixed rates for a 10-minute tour\r\n        and an additional fee per lesson. The more tours you buy, the lower the\r\n        rate, so water-ski enthusiasts will certainly get value for money.\r\n        Sailing and Yachting\r\n        With balmy trade winds, infrequent squalls, and flowing sea\r\n        currents, the FWI and nearby Antilles are ideal for a day, a week, or a\r\n        month under sail. As every islander knows, many of the most gorgeous\r\n        coves and beaches are reachable only by boat. For a fairly modest sum\r\n        per person, you might consider chartering a skippered sloop or\r\n        catamaran for a full day.\r\n        From Martinique, the popular 10-day or two-week sail takes\r\n        you to St. Lucia and down into the Grenadines. From Guadeloupe, try Les\r\n        Saintes and Marie-Galante, which both have safe anchorages or sail\r\n        further to Antigua. A 12-m (40-ft) two-masted vessel sleeping a maximum\r\n        of six with captain and one crew member can be taken from either\r\n        Martinique or Guadeloupe???for a small fortune, of course.\r\n        To do it yourself, or charter ?bareboat,? you?ll need to\r\n        demonstrate proficiency. You?ll find various vessels for charter at the\r\n        yachting car?nage in Pointe-?-Pitre, at Fort-de-France, or across its\r\n        bay at the Pointe-du-Bout marina, and at Saint-Martin?s Marigot. During\r\n        the peak season (mid-December to mid-April) rates are higher.\r\n        Among the yachts advertised for charter in Guadeloupe is a\r\n        24-m (80-ft) ketch built for the late King Farouk.\r\n        Fishing\r\n        The FWI are somewhat removed from the great game-fishing\r\n        waters off the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, but the\r\n        average angler will find challenges aplenty here from boat or shore.\r\n        There are a limited number of deep-sea boats for charter; they normally\r\n        accommodate up to four people. Local fishermen might also agree to take\r\n        you out in their time-tested, no-frills boats. This may mean you?ll\r\n        have to help with nets or traps, an instructive experience.\r\n        Surfcasting with lures (called spinning), is outstanding at\r\n        three points in southeast Martinique: Cap Ferr?, Cap Macr?, and Cap\r\n        Chevalier. Local buffs say it?s also excellent at llet Hardy, Pointe\r\n        Baham, and Grand-Rivi?re. Expect to haul in jacks, barracuda,\r\n        yellowtail snapper, tarpon (best with bait off Vauclin), dolphin, red\r\n        hind, and jewfish.\r\n        Bottom fishing may get you grouper, tarpon, mahogany or red\r\n        snapper, parrotfish, grunts, and, rarely, African pompano. In\r\n        Martinique the best bottom fishing is probably at Le Robert and Les\r\n        Salines.\r\n        Guadeloupe, with more fully equipped ocean-going boats than\r\n        Martinique, offers deep-sea fishing for kingfish, tuna barracuda,\r\n        bonito, and dolphin. You should find some or all of these in\r\n        Saint-Martin?s waters as well, with about a dozen boats available for\r\n        charter. Wahoo, one of the ?big five? game fish, is hooked occasionally\r\n        off all the islands.\r\n        Before frying up your catch, remember to check with local\r\n        fishermen about edibility (see page 117).\r\n        Golf\r\n        A few long fairway shots away from Josephine?s birthplace\r\n        at La Pagerie is Martinique?s 18-hole public golf course. It?s also\r\n        only a short ride (21?2 km/11?2 miles) from the Pointe-du-Bout hotels,\r\n        some of which have special package arrangements with the club. The\r\n        prolific American golfing architect Robert Trent Jones, Sr. , designed\r\n        this rolling 6,072-m (6,640-yard) course, a factor ensuring it?s not\r\n        easy to play. It?s generally windy here, and there are eight water\r\n        holes (including two on the Fort-de-France bay). Guadeloupe?s course,\r\n        also by Jones, at Saint-Fran?ois, is relatively flat, but the winds\r\n        here make it quite ?interesting. ? Golf in Saint-Martin is offered only\r\n        on the Dutch side of the island.\r\n        Greens fees are constant year round. Material for hire\r\n        includes electric cars and pull carts. Or you can engage a caddy; it?s\r\n        always pleasant to have company.\r\n        Tennis\r\n        You will be able to play tennis by day or night at all of\r\n        Guadeloupe?s resort hotels, at most of Saint-Martin?s, and at some of\r\n        Martinique?s (where tourists may also use two private clubs???Tennis\r\n        Club de Fort-de-France and Tennis Club du Vieux Moulin???when the\r\n        courts are not in use). Playing away from your hotel will probably be\r\n        very expensive during the day and exorbitant under lights. Rackets may\r\n        be rented. Surfaces are artificial. Professionals give lessons at many\r\n        hotels, the price sometimes included in tennis-package vacations. Until\r\n        you?re accustomed to the climate, play only before 10 in the morning\r\n        and in the late afternoon and evening.\r\n        Horseback Riding\r\n        There are several stables on Martinique where hotels can\r\n        arrange for tourists to rent horses by the hour or the day. Or you can\r\n        join an organized group excursion following country trails through\r\n        scenic landscapes.\r\n        On Guadeloupe, rides in the countryside can be arranged.\r\n        For further information contact Comit? Guadeloup?en des Sports\r\n        Equestres, B.P. 758, 97172 Pointe-?-Pitre.\r\n        On St. Barts, ?La Petite Ferme? organizes horseback rides\r\n        on Sundays.\r\n        Saint-Martin, too, has opportunities for riders in a number\r\n        of stables.\r\n        Hiking\r\n        Guadeloupe?s huge Natural Park has trails laid out through\r\n        the tropical forest, up to major waterfalls, and on to the crater of La\r\n        Soufri?re. You?ll find a printed guide indicating times and difficulty\r\n        of various hikes at the Pointe-?-Pitre tourist office.\r\n        On Martinique, trails have been marked through the\r\n        Caravelle peninsula nature reserve, and local guides will take you\r\n        along more rugged trails around Mount Pel?e in the north. A hiking path\r\n        connects Le Pr?cheur with Grand-Rivi?re, advertised as a six-hour\r\n        journey.\r\n        Shopping\r\n        If you?re not French, think French. Particularly on\r\n        Martinique and Guadeloupe, where the outstanding bargains are in\r\n        perfumes, Parisian fashions, crystal, and other luxury items from\r\n        France. On duty-free Saint-Martin and Saint-Barth?lemy, the range of\r\n        best buys is even greater. There are local handicraft items for sale on\r\n        all four islands that are interesting and reasonably priced, but shop\r\n        off the obvious tourist beat, and don?t hesitate to bargain.\r\n        At hotel boutiques, prices may or may not be the same as in\r\n        urban shopping areas: for anything major, it?s worth comparing. Opening\r\n        hours are as follows: ordinary shops and stores 8am to noon and 2 to\r\n        5pm; supermarkets, department stores, and bookshops 8:30am to 12:30pm\r\n        and 2:30 to 5:30pm; boutiques 9am to 1pm and 3 to 6pm.\r\n        Some stores are open after normal hours or on Sundays or\r\n        holidays when cruise ships are in port. Better shops are\r\n        air-conditioned.\r\n        All of the islands accept American or Canadian dollars\r\n        about as readily as French francs. Many shops in Guadeloupe and\r\n        Martinique give discounts (usually 20 percent) for purchases in\r\n        traveler?s checks, but not if you pay in foreign currency. On\r\n        Martinique you?re likely to get the same discount if you pay with one\r\n        of the major credit cards.\r\n        Neither Martinique nor Guadeloupe enjoy duty-free status\r\n        (apart from the duty-free shops at the airports), but almost everything\r\n        from France is sold at mainland French prices, well below what the\r\n        items would cost in North America.\r\n        While Americans returning home must pay 10% duty on\r\n        everything above $600 worth of purchases made abroad, the US customs\r\n        levy added to the price of an item may still come to less than what the\r\n        purchases would cost in Boston or Chicago. Any goods shipped back from\r\n        FWI require a 10% duty regardless of the monetary value. (It is illegal\r\n        to ship alcoholic beverages. )\r\n        A wise idea is to price major items at home before your\r\n        vacation. To avoid possible complications with customs, veteran\r\n        travelers ask for and retain a receipt (sales slip) for everything\r\n        purchased.\r\n        Guadeloupe?s Shopping Scene\r\n        Aside from a few boutiques and native crafts shops around\r\n        the island, notably in or near hotels, interesting shopping is\r\n        concentrated in an area of Pointe-?-Pitre several city blocks square,\r\n        beginning at the cruise ship dock.\r\n        Best buys: French perfumes, silk items, porcelain, crystal\r\n        liqueurs, and vintage wines.\r\n        Good buys: cloth hangings of Creole scenes, seashell\r\n        jewelry, straw mats and hats, particularly from Saint-Barth?lemy, local\r\n        rum, and conch shells (beautiful specimens can be had for just a few\r\n        francs apiece from curbside peddlers near the maritime terminal, but\r\n        only when a cruise ship is about to depart).\r\n        A standard Guadeloupe souvenir is a puffed-up,\r\n        porcupine-spined puffer fish (poisson lane), which, if large enough,\r\n        can become an offbeat lamp shade. You should also see items crafted\r\n        from shark?s teeth and occasionally even entire jaws.\r\n        Martinique?s Shopping Scene\r\n        Much of downtown Fort- de-France is fertile territory for\r\n        shoppers. For tourists at Pointe-du-Bout it?s worth taking the\r\n        20-minute ferry ride to the capital to investigate prices there before\r\n        shopping at the resort hotel boutiques. Elsewhere on the island there\r\n        are a handful of craft workshops.\r\n        Best buys: perfumes and other French luxury items as listed\r\n        for Guadeloupe; you?ll also find neckties and the best Parisian silk\r\n        scarves on sale at reasonable prices (which incorporates a 20 percent\r\n        traveler?s check discount).\r\n        Good buys: the island?s typical poup?e martiniquaise, a\r\n        doll in madras Creole costume on sale everywhere; tapestries, wicker\r\n        trays, and boxes, and the memorable dark (aged) or white rum.\r\n        Before buying anthuriums or other flowers, check your\r\n        re-entry regulations at home.\r\n        Facing the ferry pier on the Fort-de-France waterfront is\r\n        an outdoor pavilion where you might try bargaining for straw hats and\r\n        baskets, conch shells, huge wooden forks, or seashell necklaces. Some\r\n        of the salesladies at this colorful, soft-sell market wear traditional\r\n        Martinique costumes. Fort-de-France?s main shopping streets,\r\n        tourist-oriented or not, are between the Savane and the Levassor\r\n        River.\r\n        Shops on Martinique stock a selection of mainland Chinese,\r\n        Philippine, African, Haitian, and Japanese jewelry. Watch for onyx from\r\n        Argentina and shark-cartilage pendants from Uruguay, among other exotic\r\n        items.\r\n        Duty-Free Delights: Saint-Martin and Saint-Barth?lemy\r\n        For many items, the two small northern islands have the\r\n        lowest prices in the Caribbean. Some residents of the ?duty-free? US\r\n        Virgin Islands nearby even do their Christmas shopping in Philipsburg,\r\n        Marigot, or Gustavia. It takes a while to realize that not just certain\r\n        stores, but every store on these islands sells at the same taxless,\r\n        duty-free prices.\r\n        Almost everything is quoted in US dollars, but, of course,\r\n        you can pay in French francs or Netherlands Antilles guilders. While\r\n        prices for French perfumes and fashions may not be appreciably lower\r\n        here than in the rest of the FWI, they could be half of what Americans\r\n        would pay at home.\r\n        In all three little capitals, shopping begins where the\r\n        boats come in. There are also a few small shops in Grand-Case.\r\n        Best buys on French Saint-Martin and to a lesser extent on\r\n        St. Barts include: perfumes and cosmetics, luggage, fashions, fabrics\r\n        including madras, crystal, leather, figurines, and children?s\r\n        clothes.\r\n        Savor the French Riviera-style a tmosphere of Marina Port\r\n        La Royale, Marigot?s chic shop-and-dine center on the lagoon side.\r\n        At the busy Front Street shops in Philipsburg, you can buy\r\n        Delft blue, jewels, Thai silks, linens, Peruvian mirrors, old silver,\r\n        and liquor.\r\n        Not everything is automatically a bargain: American\r\n        tourists may find that certain calculators and cameras, for example,\r\n        are just as inexpensive at discount stores back home. However, on\r\n        Saint-Martin and St. Barts you?ll also be saving the city or state\r\n        sales tax that may be levied at home.\r\n        Local Culture and Events\r\n        Music and Dance\r\n        Swaying rhythms are among the most appealing aspects of\r\n        life in the French West Indies. While islanders of all ages love to\r\n        dance, you may have to search a bit nowadays to find the gay and\r\n        flirtatious biguine, the romantic Creole mazurka or mazouk, the\r\n        sensually suggestive calenda. Like the rest of the Caribbean, the FWI\r\n        are inundated by the marvelous steel band calypsos of Trinidad, the\r\n        merengue of Dominica, and the reggae and rampa?not to mention North\r\n        American and European pop music???courtesy of the transistor, and the\r\n        more recently popular craze: zouk.\r\n        The authentic FWI dances originated with the African\r\n        slaves. Some are adaptations of those of the French plantation masters.\r\n        The biguine, immortalized for Anglo-Saxons by Cole Porter, is thought\r\n        to have come first to Martinique from the Congo. Those Creole men and\r\n        women you?ll see dancing it properly have been moving their hips and\r\n        knees that way since childhood. Dixieland fans will notice the\r\n        instrumental similarity to New Orleans?banjo, clarinet, bass, trombone,\r\n        and drums.\r\n        The laghia???in which two men, dancing to drums alone,\r\n        simulate a fierce kicking combat???arrived with slaves from Dahomey.\r\n        Only in the country during patron saint day festivals or at a folk\r\n        dance performance are you likely to see rose, a slave woman?s washing\r\n        dance; grage, with dancers mimicking tapioca graters to the beat of\r\n        goat-skin drums; the haute-taille, an adaptation with accordion and\r\n        drums of a European quadrille; or the bel-air, an African-Creole\r\n        version of a three-figure quadrille.\r\n        Twenty-five young dancers, singers, and musicians in the\r\n        Ballets Martiniquais Folklore group perform traditional local\r\n        favorites, as do less formal groups on Guadeloupe. Here you?ll see the\r\n        delightful but slowly disappearing indigenous FWI costume???madras\r\n        turban, madras skirt over petticoat, silk peplum, white blouse, and\r\n        gold earrings, bracelets, and collier-choux necklace.\r\n        Carnival\r\n        It may not be the wildest in the Caribbean, but the FWI?s\r\n        carnival is the longest, by 24 hours. Early in the week there are\r\n        pajama, ?doudou? doll, and pirate parades, plus always-spectacular\r\n        carnival floats. The riotous revelry roars right past Mardi Gras\r\n        (Shrove Tuesday) when red-costumed children star as devils, to its peak\r\n        on Ash Wednesday. Downtown Fort-de-France and Pointe-?-Pitre are\r\n        flooded with dancers, notably diablesses, all dressed in black and\r\n        white and losing themselves in the biguine. The carnival king, Vaval,\r\n        is burned in effigy after dusk, but the frenzied dancing goes on till\r\n        after midnight.\r\n        Special Events\r\n        Aside from carnival and patron saints? days in the towns,\r\n        you?ll enjoy:\r\n        Fishermen?s Festival (F?te des Marins P?cheurs) late in\r\n        June on Martinique, with parades, fish feasts, and traditional\r\n        costumes.\r\n        Cooks? Festival (F?te des Cuisini?res) in early August in\r\n        Pointe-?-Pitre, with a colorful, appetite-stimulating parade, a\r\n        religious ceremony honoring Saint Laurent (chosen as the local cooks?\r\n        patron saint because in a.d. 258 he was burned alive on a rack, which\r\n        is now a kitchen utensil) and a monumental free feast with singing,\r\n        dancing, and liberal applications of rum punch.\r\n        All Saints? Day (La Toussaint) 1 November, when, after\r\n        dark, in an original and beautiful Antilles tradition, all graves in\r\n        cemeteries are illuminated with candles.\r\n        Folk Beliefs\r\n        Don?t sleep in the rays of the moon?your facial features\r\n        will be distorted. Pour some rum into a dead man?s mouth to cheer him\r\n        up, otherwise he?ll come back to haunt the house. These and other\r\n        superstitions are held by many FWI citizens. Many of the strange twigs,\r\n        herbs, and packets you?ll see in the markets have to do with magic\r\n        based on traditions that stem from the African origins of most of the\r\n        population. This is not, however, the voodoo of Haiti, and there are no\r\n        ?black magic? performances staged for tourists.\r\n        Early missionaries used to say tiens, bois! (here, drink! )\r\n        when they gave medicine to ailing islanders. It seemed magical when\r\n        maladies were cured, and from tiens, bois derived the word quimbois,\r\n        for magic potion or spell. Today in most villages on Martinique and\r\n        Guadeloupe there are still quimboiseurs who mix the mysterious\r\n        concoctions. They are considered useful for divining the future,\r\n        prescribing remedies for problems, and perhaps putting a spell on an\r\n        enemy.\r\n        The ordinary tourist will find it difficult to obtain\r\n        precise details about this magic, which is known as obeah around the\r\n        West Indies.\r\n        Nightlife\r\n        There?s little danger that the French West Indies will ever\r\n        be overrun with ?swinging? after-hours resorts. But Guadeloupe is\r\n        making an effort. On its ?riviera? along the southern coast of\r\n        Grande-Terre, there are a number of private discotheques and rural\r\n        nightclubs in addition to the hotel lounges. Tourists are welcome at\r\n        such nightspots, where they?re likely to be outnumbered by\r\n        rhythm-loving Guadeloupeans. Advertisements suggest there is striptease\r\n        occasionally in this area, logical???or illogical? ? ??on an island\r\n        promoting nudism.\r\n        On Martinique, all but the most adventurous tourists will\r\n        prefer dancing and drinking in their hotels. Here they?ll have the\r\n        latest calypso mixed with more familiar pop and soul. The admission\r\n        charge at hotel lounges includes the first drink. Fort-de-France and\r\n        its suburbs have a smattering of very local, very crowded discotheques\r\n        where foreigners rarely appear. One reason: most of the island?s resort\r\n        hotels are quite a distance from the capital.\r\n        If folklore performers, steel bands, or limbo dancers visit\r\n        your resort area, they usually perform during dinner, so you just sit\r\n        down and enjoy the show, generally outdoors.\r\n        Guadeloupe and Martinique have a couple of hotel casinos,\r\n        modest and low-key by international standards, but perfectly able to\r\n        accommodate you if you?d like to risk your next year?s salary. There is\r\n        a large, bright, new casino in Schoelcher, the northern outskirt of\r\n        Fort-de-France. The casinos, open nightly from 9pm until at least 3am,\r\n        offer roulette, American blackjack, baccarat, and sometimes craps, and,\r\n        in Martinique, French boule. Drinks are available and expensive.\r\n        There?s an admission charge, you must be at least 21 to\r\n        enter, and you must present your passport or other official\r\n        identification each time you go. At a slightly disadvantageous rate,\r\n        you can exchange foreign currency or traveler?s checks for franc chips.\r\n        Succumbing to Caribbean-wide informality, the casinos do not require\r\n        men to wear a tie or jacket.\r\n        If your French is good or just needs some polishing, both\r\n        major islands have movie theaters that show European and American films\r\n        with French soundtracks only. Seat prices won?t ruin you.\r\n        On Saint-Martin, lingering over a seaside dinner is the\r\n        preferred after-dark activity on the French side, where most lights go\r\n        out by 9 or 10pm. For livelier late-nights spots, head for the Dutch\r\n        side with its revues and well-publicized hotel casinos.\r\n        On St. Barts, soon after nightfall, the most popular\r\n        leisure activity is sleep???at least out of season. But a bit of\r\n        nightlife is available in the thick of the tourist season.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n
