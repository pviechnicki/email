I'd like to suggest that the tax\r\nsystem should go much, much farther down this road, particularly the sales tax.\r\nUnder my plan, sales taxes would only be not eliminated on certain socially\r\ndesirable purchases, but also good shoppers would receive an anti-tax, a bonus\r\nfor their beneficent purchases.\r\n\r\n            For example, in New York City you're charged an 8\r\n1/4 percent tax when you buy a book. I propose that when you buy a really good\r\nbook--say, a Patrick O'Brian, he's marvelous!--you'd be paid a 10 percent\r\nbonus: Buy a $20 book; receive $2 from the city.\r\n\r\n            Buy a TV set and you should pay a tax: Your\r\npurchase will make you fat and stupid. Buy a TV set that operates only when you\r\npedal a bicycle-powered generator, and you receive a bonus: Your purchase will\r\nmake you thin and stupid.\r\n\r\n            Rent a copy of Seven Samurai , a fine movie,\r\nand you get the bonus. Rent Three Ninjas and you pay a tax, but you can\r\ncheck a box that allocates your money to hire a guy to beat the hell out of\r\nJack Valenti.\r\n\r\n            The question, of course,\r\nis who decides which items are taxed and which earn the buyer a bonus. I do. By\r\nmaking these decisions a matter of narrow self-interest, my reform remains\r\nwithin the historical context of the present system, where tax rates are set to\r\nbenefit the rich and powerful. My system would differ only in benefiting a\r\ndifferent self. And what's good for me would no doubt be good for the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Bracket Creep\r\nAnswer\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \"If you don't want to pay your taxes today all you\r\nhave to do is say two magic words: installment agreement .\"\r\n\r\n            \"You just say you want one and even if the terms\r\nyou propose are ridiculous--like $10 a week when you owe tens of\r\nthousands--collection stops while your proposal goes up and down the chain of\r\nmanagers, until 90 days later you are told no. Then you need to say another\r\nmagic word--harassment--and because of this new law, the collection process\r\nstops while your complaint gets reviewed.\"\r\n\r\n            This new law is\r\nCongress' way to bully the IRS into acting nicer. As a result, seizures of\r\nproperty in lieu of back taxes are down 98 percent this year. Other attempts to\r\nget people to pay what they owe are also way down. Many IRS officials say the\r\ndrop stems from their fear of running afoul of the new niceness laws and\r\ngetting fired.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Ananda Gupta's\r\nCool American Bible Follow-Up\r\n            \r\n\r\n            There is a board game based on the Battle of\r\nArmageddon.\r\n\r\n            Some details:\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               2 to 3 players.\r\n\r\n               Units represent Magog (Russia), the Kings of the East (China), the Western\r\nempires (USA and Europe), Israel, and the Arabs.\r\n\r\n               The West gets a piece representing the antichrist.\r\n\r\n               When you throw the die to resolve a battle and a 6 comes up, an\r\n\"apocalyptic event\"--Euphrates dries up, sky turns blood red interfering with\r\nair units, etc.--occurs.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The game is published by\r\nthe Microgame\r\nCo-op, a small operation run by a Canadian named Kerry Anderson.
