But at Easter, he rose. That, at least, is what Newt\r\nGingrich's apostles are saying about him, pointing to their man's successful\r\ntrip to the Far East and his return to public visibility following the\r\ncongressional spring recess.\r\n\r\n            Newt is\r\nsounding like his old self again. Wednesday he called for abolition of both the\r\ncapital-gains tax and the estate tax. (For more on the capital-gains debate,\r\nsee this \"Dialogue\" between Michael Kinsley and John C. Goodman.) In an\r\nhour-long speech to GOPAC Monday night, he boasted about the Contract With\r\nAmerica's influence in Mongolia. Once again the historical pedant, he explained\r\nwhy the Clinton campaign-finance scandal--which he previously called merely\r\n\"worse than Watergate\"--is actually tantamount to the fall of Rome. In ancient\r\ntimes, \"sending lobbyists and offering bribes to Rome became the easiest and\r\nmost profitable route to wealth and power for many local leaders,\" Gingrich\r\nsaid. \"If it is proven that the Chinese Communists were trying to funnel money\r\ninto a presidential defense fund, then the Roman model of foreign corruption\r\nwill indeed be raising its head within the American system.\"\r\n\r\n            Contrary to the media hype and rumors floating around\r\nWashington, Gingrich will probably not be deposed before the next election. To\r\nget rid of him would require not just a few dozen defections, but a majority\r\nvote of the House Republican caucus. There is still no fully plausible\r\nsuccessor, and sacking Gingrich would mean Republicans running in 1998 on a\r\nrecord of catastrophe rather than mere inaction. At the same time, the\r\nprecariousness of Newt's position is making him and other Republican leaders\r\nact in weird, unpredictable ways. The speaker's shakiness has turned the House\r\ninto a strange and somewhat silly place.\r\n\r\n            The most\r\nobvious effect of Gingrich's insecurity is on his own behavior, which has\r\nconsisted lately of dramatic lurches, first to the left, then to the right.\r\nBefore his China trip, Gingrich's comeback strategy was to show that he was not\r\nthe radical-right ogre of Mother Jones direct mail. He made nice with\r\nJesse Jackson and announced that he was dropping affirmative action as an\r\nissue. He warmly received Alec Baldwin and other liberal actors, who came to\r\nlobby on behalf of the National Endowment for the Arts. Though Baldwin had been\r\nquoted calling him \"evil,\" Gingrich invited him and the other thespians back\r\nfor dinner, and declared that the NEA might not be such a bad thing after all.\r\nConservatives who were annoyed by Newt's nice-guy act were truly outraged when\r\nhe suggested that one way to get a balanced-budget agreement might be to put\r\noff tax cuts.\r\n\r\n            \r\nThis gambit was based on what was at least a\r\nplausible political calculation. If Republicans could separate their tax cuts\r\nin the public mind from the domestic budget cuts necessary to balance the\r\nbudget, Democrats could no longer accuse them of throwing old people into the\r\nsnow in order to save money for Steve Forbes. The idea was also to do with\r\ntaxes what House Republicans had shrewdly done with welfare reform in 1996,\r\nholding the president's feet to the fire by sending him a politically popular\r\nstand-alone bill. But the result of Gingrich's suggestion was blind fury on the\r\nright. Eleven of the freshman hotheads elected in 1994 openly challenged the\r\nspeaker's leadership. In a short, shocking article in the Weekly\r\nStandard , Rep. Peter King of New York called Gingrich \"political road\r\nkill.\" In the last Congress, Gingrich didn't have to stand for this kind of\r\ninsubordination. Faced with an episode of dissent back then, he stripped one\r\nnonconformist freshman of a choice committee assignment.\r\n\r\n            Now,\r\nhowever, Gingrich lacks the power to punish, and can do little more than suck\r\nup to his conservative critics. He apologized profusely for the\r\n\"misunderstanding\" about his comments on tax cuts. His GOPAC speech was filled\r\nwith right-wing red meat, such as a proposed crackdown on the political\r\ninfluence of unions and a demand that the Internal Revenue Service be brought\r\nto heel. On April 9, he surprised everyone by proposing a more aggressive tax\r\ncut than any of his more conservative GOP colleagues, calling for an end to all\r\ntaxes on both capital gains and estates, changes that would cost the Treasury\r\nsome $300 billion over five years. In keeping with conservative newspeak,\r\nGingrich referred to these as the taxes on \"savings and job creation\" and the\r\ntax on \"death benefits.\"\r\n\r\n            Gingrich is not the only one behaving erratically. As he\r\nmoves to shore up his right-wing credentials, his more authentically\r\nconservative rivals are trying to establish their own credibility in the eyes\r\nof moderate Republicans. The first to suggest that going after the NEA again\r\nmight not be such a hot idea was not Gingrich, but the libertarian Majority\r\nLeader Dick Armey. When he came out with his put-off-the-tax-cuts suggestion,\r\nGingrich was actually endorsing a proposal by ultracon Republican Whip Tom\r\nDeLay. DeLay has been taking sudden umbrage at accusations that he is a tool of\r\ncorporate lobbyists. Armey has been losing weight and restraining his\r\nproclivity toward quasioffensive humor. (At one press conference earlier this\r\nyear, he joked, \"I'm happy to be black--I mean back,\" and chided journalists\r\nabout their preference for the Old Testament.) Gossip swirls about the four-way\r\nrivalry among the top Republicans who rank just below Gingrich: Armey, DeLay,\r\nJohn Boehner, and Bill Paxon. The latest rumor has Armey and Paxon teaming up\r\nas speaker and majority leader.\r\n\r\n            All this\r\njockeying has forestalled any real Republican agenda. Compared with the\r\nhyperactive 104 th Congress, the 105 th has been a joke.\r\nWhat little time it has actually been in session it has spent on issues like a\r\nresolution supporting the Georgia judge who posted the Ten Commandments in his\r\ncourtroom, and a congressional gold medal for Frank Sinatra. Last week, the\r\nHouse passed a resolution banning the use of federal funds for assisted\r\nsuicide. Of course, no federal funds go to assisted suicide. In a caucus\r\nmeeting last week, Gingrich reportedly said that Republican critics who\r\ncomplained he had no agenda \"weren't smart enough to understand it.\"\r\n\r\n            \r\nThe most damaging consequence of Gingrich's\r\nweakness is the difficulty of negotiating what might be the GOP's proudest\r\nachievement--an agreement to balance the budget. The paradox is that while a\r\ndeal would shore up Newt's position, he hasn't got enough power to negotiate\r\none. Though the GOP and the administration are quite close on the numbers,\r\nthose on Newt's right flank are likely to portray any agreement with the\r\npresident as a capitulation born of weakness. In 1995, Gingrich had the clout\r\nto make a centrist budget compromise stick. Now such an agreement would\r\nprobably provoke open rebellion, divide the House, and deprive the speaker of a\r\nworking majority.\r\n\r\n            The result is a complex\r\nstalemate. Republicans face the prospect of running in 1998 with a discredited,\r\nunpopular speaker who is nonetheless impossible to dethrone, and with no record\r\nof accomplishment. As the Democratic National Committee sinks deeper into\r\nscandal-related debt, the Democrats can look forward to running without a\r\nfunctional party organization to support them. The lame vs. the destitute--it\r\ncould be a great race.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n   \r\n"},"properties":[{"key":"SourceSystemId","values":["9GCIHO36T2U4.MAUWNFAN8IVG1@mimefactory.state.tld"]},{"key":"Sender","values":["{\"Name\":null,\"Address\":\"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev\",\"RoutingType\":\"SMTP\",\"MailboxType\":\"Mailbox\",\"Id\":null}"]},{"key":"IngestedFromMailbox","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"BirthId","values":["2c4b8869-7a80-4049-8d84-ec7b72efd11a"]},{"key":"SizeInKb","values":["15.642"]},{"key":"Sensitivity","values":["Official"]},{"key":"IsTransitory","values":["False"]},{"key":"SensitivityAssigned","values":["ClientAssigned"]},{"key":"AttachmentCount","values":["0"]},{"key":"IsCapstone","values":["False"]},{"key":"IsRecord","values":["True"]},{"key":"Classification","values":[""]},{"key":"MetadataGenerated","values":["2017-11-09T00:52:39.3746137Z"]},{"key":"MetadataGeneratorVersion","values":["0.1.1108.2"]},{"key":"Source","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"SourceType","values":["EmailExchange"]},{"key":"DispositionType","values":["Official"]},{"key":"DispositionDate","values":["2024-11-06T23:57:46Z"]}],"security":{"securityDescriptors":["RECORD","OFFICIAL","eRecords"],"signatures":[]},"users":[{"userRoles":["From"],"id":122,"originalSmtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","smtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"firstName":"svcErecMbxPusher","userValidFrom":"2017-04-18T10:34:19.84","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\svcErecMbxPusher","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"svcErecMbxPusher","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7143","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":154,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb10Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb10Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb10Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"eRecJmb10Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7164","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":165,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb19Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb19Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb19Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"eRecJmb19Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7182","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":186,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb31Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb31Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb31Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"eRecJmb31Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7206","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"}]},"errata":[{"type":"Warning","task":"ParseJournal","field":"JournalReport","value":"","reason":"No Journal Reports for Email"},{"type":"Information","task":"ParseMime","field":"SensitivityAssigned","value":"","reason":"No Sensitivity Assigned Header"}],"indexLocation":"email_official7yr_2017_m11"}
