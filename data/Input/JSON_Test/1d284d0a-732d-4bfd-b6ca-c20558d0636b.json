She's the anti-Garbo: She doesn't vant to be alone.\r\nFor an \"object of beauty,\" Roberts has an astounding amount of chemistry with\r\nother actors. She managed to penetrate Rupert Everett's languid self-regard in\r\nMy Best Friend's Wedding (1997) and made the brilliant but remote Denzel\r\nWashington almost puppyish in The Pelican Brief (1993). In the past,\r\nHugh Grant has mainly had chemistry with Hugh Grant, yet in this summer's\r\nNotting Hill , he focused on something other than his own adorableness.\r\nAbove all, Roberts warms up Richard Gere. An actor known for a narcissistic\r\nblend of preening and Buddha-like self-containment, Gere proved in Pretty\r\nWoman (1990) to be a marvel at reflecting her light, like a piece of space\r\ndebris that in the rays of the sun reveals jewellike facets.\r\n\r\n            The pair's reunion,\r\nRunaway Bride , is a laborious screwball romance, which, in its first\r\nhalf-hour, had me checking off the details it got wrong about journalism,\r\nsmall-town life, and human relations. Roberts plays Maggie Carpenter, a\r\nhardware store clerk ( check ) and junk sculptor ( check ) with a\r\ntendency to panic and leave her grooms open-mouthed at the altar. Gere is Ike\r\nGraham, a New York-based USA Today columnist, who hears about Maggie in\r\na bar and, without even a call to confirm his facts ( check ), devotes his\r\nnext piece to an un-PC screed on the inconstancy of all women ( check )\r\nwith this \"runaway bride\" as Exhibit A. The column makes him instantly\r\n( check ) unpopular with all those Manhattan USA Today readers\r\n( check ) who recognize him on the street ( check ), not to mention\r\nthe hordes of small-town USA Today readers who wait for the paper's\r\ndelivery truck as if it were the Good Humor man ( check ). After the\r\nsubject of the column responds with a letter composed on a manual typewriter\r\n( check ) disputing its facts, his editor and ex-wife ( check ) (Rita\r\nWilson) promptly ( check ) fires him ( check ).\r\n\r\n            My notebook has about 50 more checks, but once the premise\r\nhad been established and the leads began to interact, I stopped totting up the\r\ninanities and had a good time. The director, Garry Marshall (he did Pretty\r\nWoman , too), isn't especially talented at tying up loose ends or gliding\r\nover awkward inconsistencies. His strength is that he loves actors (he's an\r\namusing one himself). He'll drop everything for a goofy face, a riff, a flaky\r\nbit of business. It doesn't matter that Joan Cusack as Maggie's hairdresser\r\npal, or Laurie Metcalf as a busybody baker, or Hector Elizondo as Ike's\r\nex-wife's husband and also his best buddy ( check ) don't have much in the\r\nway of rounded parts. They're in there improvising and having a blast. Compare\r\nthese larky turns to the robotic caricatures in Nora Ephron's 1998 You've\r\nGot Mail --it's the difference between a director who thinks she has it all\r\nfigured out and one who says, \"Surprise me, make me laugh.\"\r\n\r\n            Maggie is a great role\r\nfor Roberts, who can be alternately warm and skittish, promiscuous and clammy.\r\nEach of her weddings (Ike gets a videotape) is a terrific slapstick turn. Watch\r\nRoberts' head swivel away from an expectant groom as if anti-magnetized,\r\nbearing her out of the church on its own power. Gere, meanwhile, has become\r\nexceedingly likable. Perhaps it's all the Zen meditation, which has mellowed\r\nhis showy Method edges. His enviably thick hair has gone from salt-and-pepper\r\nto just salt, and those tiny, Slavic eyes have acquired a worldly glint.\r\nAlternately mocking Maggie and enjoying her hugely, he's like a happy,\r\nlaid-back stalker.\r\n\r\n            In the event I ever teach a filmmaking class, I'm going to\r\nhave a special unit on \"The Work of Hugh Hudson: What Not To Do.\" The riotously\r\ninept Revolution (1985) will be the ur-text, but I might find a place\r\nfor the genteel My Life So Far . It's not that it's bad, it's that on a\r\ndramatic level it barely exists. I've never read the source text, a memoir by\r\nSir Denis Forman about his affluent Scottish childhood, but another Forman\r\nbook, A Night at the Opera , is one of my bibles--a cheeky guide to the\r\ngenre by a former deputy chairman of London's Royal Opera House. This movie is\r\nsupposed to be about the way the arrival of his uncle's dishy young French wife\r\n(Ir?ne Jacob) throws the estate into a libidinous chaos, but Hudson's camera is\r\nalways in the right place to catch the rolling hills and splendid staircases\r\nand in the wrong place to catch the actors' expressions. The loss is especially\r\nvexing since the actors (Colin Firth, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Rosemary\r\nHarris, Malcolm McDowell) might be giving fine performances, and Robbie Norman\r\nas the boy might be extraordinary. The script might even be good. We'll just\r\nnever know.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n   \r\n"},"properties":[{"key":"SourceSystemId","values":["3ZICYWU4T2U4.XD13SHRSIKDD3@mimefactory.state.tld"]},{"key":"Sender","values":["{\"Name\":null,\"Address\":\"svcErecMbxPusher2@state.udev\",\"RoutingType\":\"SMTP\",\"MailboxType\":\"Mailbox\",\"Id\":null}"]},{"key":"IngestedFromMailbox","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"BirthId","values":["1d284d0a-732d-4bfd-b6ca-c20558d0636b"]},{"key":"SizeInKb","values":["10.433"]},{"key":"Sensitivity","values":["Official"]},{"key":"SensitivityAssigned","values":["TransitoryModified"]},{"key":"IsTransitory","values":["True"]},{"key":"AttachmentCount","values":["0"]},{"key":"IsCapstone","values":["False"]},{"key":"IsRecord","values":["True"]},{"key":"Classification","values":[""]},{"key":"MetadataGenerated","values":["2017-11-08T15:07:44.2305188Z"]},{"key":"MetadataGeneratorVersion","values":["0.1.1107.1"]},{"key":"Source","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"SourceType","values":["EmailExchange"]},{"key":"DispositionType","values":["Transitory"]},{"key":"DispositionDate","values":["2018-11-06T23:57:32Z"]}],"security":{"securityDescriptors":["RECORD","OFFICIAL","eRecords"],"signatures":[]},"users":[{"userRoles":["To"],"id":152,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb15Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb15Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-21T02:58:23.91","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb15Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"eRecJmb15Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7174","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["From"],"id":201,"originalSmtp":"svcErecMbxPusher2@state.udev","smtp":"svcErecMbxPusher2@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"userValidFrom":"2017-03-24T10:55:31.45","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\svcErecMbxPusher2","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"svcErecMbxPusher2","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7223","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"}]},"errata":[{"type":"Warning","task":"ParseJournal","field":"JournalReport","value":"","reason":"No Journal Reports for Email"},{"type":"Information","task":"ParseMime","field":"Sensitivity","value":"Transitory","reason":"Modified Sensitivity to Official from Transitory"}],"indexLocation":"email_transitory12mo_2017_w45"}
