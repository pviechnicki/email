Click for the latest update.\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\nU.N. aides\r\naccused the United States of using U.N. weapons inspectors to spy against\r\nIraq . The accusation has raised a furor because the inspectors are supposed\r\nto be independent. The conspiracy theory is that the weapons inspectors were\r\nU.S. spies. The counterconspiracy theory is that Iraq's U.N. allies are fanning\r\nthe conspiracy theory in order to soften or get rid of the inspections. U.S.\r\nofficials admit they supplied spying equipment to the inspectors but offer\r\nseveral alibis: 1) We were just helping the inspectors in response to their\r\nrequest. 2) They authorized everything we did. 3) We gathered information only\r\nto find out about Iraq's weapons programs, not to find out how to kill Saddam\r\nHussein. 4) At least we were discreet. Other countries put spies directly on\r\nthe weapons inspection team. 5) Of course the weapons inspectors spied against\r\nIraq. That's their job. 6) Without spies, the U.N. building would be empty.\r\n(1/8/99)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\nLinda Tripp\r\nsays she saw Hillary Clinton's Whitewater \"billing records\" in Vince\r\nFoster's safe in 1993, when the White House claimed they were missing. She says\r\nsomething around that time, possibly Mrs. Clinton's \"initials\" on the records,\r\nindicated that they belonged to Hillary Clinton. This is the fourth claim that\r\nputs Tripp at the nexus of all Clinton scandals. (She also claims she was the\r\nlast person to see Foster before his alleged suicide, she was pressured to\r\ncommit perjury by Monica Lewinsky in 1997, and she was the person to whom\r\nKathleen Willey confided a sexual encounter with President Clinton in November\r\n1993.) Tripp issued her latest claim in a deposition for the conservative\r\ninterest group Judicial Watch. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports\r\nthat Tripp has sent out a fund-raising letter asking for donations to her legal\r\ndefense fund to protect her from Clinton \"henchmen\" who \"have me in their cross\r\nhairs.\" (1/8/99)\r\n            \r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\n            \r\nJulie Hiatt\r\nSteele was indicted for lying about the Kathleen Willey\r\nincident . Steele had denied under oath Willey's claim that Willey told\r\nher about being groped by President Clinton. The indictment is being brought by\r\nIndependent Counsel Kenneth Starr. The spins: 1) This proves Willey was telling\r\nthe truth. 2) It proves Clinton's lawyers orchestrated Steele's false\r\ntestimony. 3) Starr is cynically bringing the indictment now to inject the\r\nWilley story into Clinton's Senate trial. 4) It proves once again that in\r\nindependent counsel investigations, the little fish get caught and the big fish\r\nget away. (1/8/99)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\nThere were no\r\nfatal U.S. airline accidents in 1998. It was the first year without an air\r\ntravel fatality in three decades. This achievement was ignored by most major\r\nnewspapers, eventually earning an inside page wire story in the Jan. 7 Los\r\nAngeles Times . The spins: 1) Hats off to the airlines for focusing on\r\nsafety. 2) Hats off to the Federal Aviation Administration for making the\r\nairlines focus more on safety than they cared to. 3) Good news is no news.\r\n(1/7/99)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\nThe National\r\nBasketball Association is back in business . NBA Commissioner David Stern,\r\nrepresenting the owners, and union chief Billy Hunter, representing the\r\nplayers, struck a deal one day before the league was expected to cancel the\r\nrest of the season. The standoff had already wiped out three months of the\r\nseason. The maximum player salary will be capped at $14 million, with a maximum\r\nannual increase of 12 percent, and the players' total share of league revenues\r\nwill be capped at 55 percent after three years. The deal still must be ratified\r\nby the owners and players. The league will play a short season of about 50\r\ngames per team beginning in early February. The spins: 1) Why did it take the\r\nplayers so long to reach a deal? 2) Why did it take the owners so long to reach\r\na deal? 3) A pox on both their houses. We'll never watch another game. We don't\r\ncare what happens to this stupid league. 4) Hey, do you think Michael Jordan is\r\ngoing to retire? (1/6/99)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\nThe 2000\r\nRepublican presidential field was shaken up . 1) Elizabeth Dole announced\r\nshe is leaving the Red Cross and giving \"serious consideration\" to running. 2)\r\nSen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., announced he won't run after all. 3) Sen. John\r\nMcCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., formed exploratory committees. The\r\nsubtle theories: Dole is running because the country is ready for a woman,\r\nAshcroft is bowing out because the 1998 elections rebuked his religious right\r\nconstituency, and McCain is running because conservatives like his Vietnam\r\nheroism and moderates like his positions on tobacco and campaign reform. The\r\nunsubtle theory: The people who are running are those who can raise $20 million\r\nor who come from New Hampshire. (1/6/99)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\nA New York\r\nCity woman was pushed in front of a subway train and killed. The mentally\r\nill man who pushed her evidently chose her at random. The spins: 1) The subways\r\nare getting dangerous again. 2) Don't be silly, crime has declined in New York,\r\nthis was an exceptional incident, and you're more likely to be struck by\r\nlightning. The thousands of New Yorkers who are avoiding the subways since the\r\nincident are fools. 3) No, the thousands of New Yorkers who are standing on the\r\nedges of subway platforms reading newspaper stories about the incident are\r\nfools. (1/6/99)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\nRep. Dennis\r\nHastert, R-Ill., was elected speaker of the House . Former pro wrestler\r\nJesse Ventura was sworn in as governor of Minnesota. Jerry Brown was sworn in\r\nas mayor of Oakland, Calif. Marion Barry stepped down as mayor of Washington,\r\nD.C. These events surprised nobody, having been foreordained weeks and months\r\nago. Nevertheless, they were trumpeted throughout the nation, because the media\r\nhad little else to talk about. (1/6/99)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Eleven European\r\ncountries adopted a common currency, the euro. The member countries\r\nhave more people and exports than the United States but a somewhat smaller\r\ngross domestic product. Spins on the monetary union: 1) It will make Europe the\r\nUnited States' new economic rival. 2) It will make Europe the United States'\r\nnew political rival. 3) European trade will be good for the U.S. economy. 4)\r\nEuropean meddling will be bad for U.S. foreign policy. 5) The euro pact will\r\npromote fiscal responsibility by limiting countries' authority to run deficits\r\nand devalue their currency. 6) The pact will promote fiscal irresponsibility by\r\nreducing stern German domination of European fiscal policy. 7) Stern German\r\ndomination? Now there's a loss. 8) The common currency will help global\r\ncorporations while stripping each European nation of its power to make its own\r\ndestiny. 9) European nationalism? Now there's a loss.\r\n(1/4/99)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\nA winter\r\nstorm blanketed the Midwest . Weather experts hyped it as one of the worst\r\nsnowstorms in decades. The spins: 1) In the Northeast, it didn't live up to\r\nbilling. 2) Yeah, but it killed dozens of people in the Midwest. 3) Yeah, but\r\nmany of them died of heart attacks while shoveling snow. 4) Yeah, but the 21\r\ninches of snow that fell on O'Hare airport in Chicago shut down most\r\ncross-country air travel. 5) OK, so it did mess up the Northeast after all.\r\n(1/4/99)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               David\r\nDuke \r\n               is back. The congressional seat in Duke's district, which\r\nis 85 percent white, is being vacated by House speaker wouldabeen Bob\r\nLivingston, R-La. Duke came to the suburbs of Washington, D.C., last weekend to\r\nraise money for the race. He told the audience he would \"stand up openly\" for\r\nwhite Christians, adding, \"If we lose European-Americans, we lose America.\" The\r\nspins: 1) He's scary. 2) No, he's washed up. 3) If he becomes a serious threat,\r\nLivingston and other GOP leaders will make sure to stop him. 4) Stop him?\r\nSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House impeachment leader Rep.\r\nBob Barr, R-Ga., have given speeches to a white citizens' group whose members\r\nattended Duke's latest fund raiser. They should be ashamed. 5) That's why\r\nthey'll make sure to stop him.
