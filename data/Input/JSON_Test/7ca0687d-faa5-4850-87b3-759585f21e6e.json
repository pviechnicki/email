The international community\r\nmust level sanctions on India for its nuclear tests, or other near-nuke countries (Taiwan, Iraq)\r\nwill be tempted to conduct their own tests. India's government is using the\r\ntests for political gain, because the economy is weak. On the Indonesian front, the editorial calls for Suharto's army\r\nto abandon him and for the International Monetary Fund to withhold loans unless\r\nSuharto steps down. ... An editorial claims that Israel is to blame for\r\nthe gradual breakdown of the Middle East peace process. The United States\r\nshould stop feebly appeasing Israel and start making clear, unwavering demands.\r\n... A book review tells the fascinating story of W.C. Minor, major\r\ncontributor to the original Oxford English Dictionary . A schizophrenic,\r\nMinor was in the midst of a delusion when he shot a man. He filed his excellent\r\nentries from a prison-hospital for the criminally insane. \"He was given two\r\ncells, one of which he turned into a library and filled with antiquarian books;\r\nhe was allowed to practise his flute and paint water-colours; and he was even\r\nallowed a knife, to cut the pages of the old books, although in the end he used\r\nit to slice off his penis.\"\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                  Details , June 1998\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nSaturday, May 16, 1998)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            A story\r\nprofiles Jared Paul Stern, promising young gossip columnist for the New York\r\nPost 's \"Page Six.\" Foppishly dressed and snottily mannered, Stern always\r\ngets his dish--but not without incurring the hatred of seemingly all New York.\r\nThe piece points out that gossip columnists are generally far more seasoned\r\nthan the 27-year-old Stern: \"Stern's success in the gossip world is seen by\r\nmany not only as an indictment of his moral character--surely it should take\r\nyears for a person to become this shallow?--but as a maddening violation of the\r\nprofessional rules.\"\r\n\r\n            \r\n               \r\n                  New\r\nRepublic , June 1\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nFriday, May 15, 1998)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The\r\nmagazine apologizes for having published fabricated articles by Stephen Glass\r\nand announces Glass' dismissal as associate editor. It acknowledges that, as\r\nhas been widely reported, Glass invented characters, organizations, and events\r\nin the recent article \"Hack Heaven\" and other pieces. How did it happen? \"For\r\nreasons known only to him, Glass mounted what appears to have been quite an\r\nelaborate effort, including the falsification of documents and reporter's\r\nnotes, to trick our editors and elude our fact-checkers.\" (For more on the\r\nuproar, see Jack Shafer's \"Glass Houses.\") ... The cover story notes the growing\r\nirrelevance of college presidents. Once, they were revered public\r\nintellectuals; now, they spend more than half their time fund raising and most\r\nof the rest on administration. They don't take high-profile stances for fear of\r\na backlash. (Full disclosure: \r\n                  Slate\r\n               's David Greenberg wrote the\r\npiece.) ...

Dozens of photographs portray neo-teens in\r\nschool, on the family farm, on inner city streets, at the mall, and in their\r\nbedrooms (all of which are apparently decorated with Hanson posters). Basic\r\nconclusion: Though cliquey, 13-year-olds are basically nice, innocent kids (who\r\nreally like Hanson). 13-year-old boy on going out with girls: \"You even talk to\r\nthem--even if it's just over the phone.\" 13-year-old Latino gang member: \"I\r\nain't down to die right now, for I'm barely having fun. I don't want to die\r\nright now.\" 13-year-old girl: \"I hate the people in our grade--they're all so\r\nboring!

In the '60s, he succumbed to\r\nschizophrenia, believing himself a \"messianic figure of great but secret\r\nimportance\" and writing cryptic messages, such as \"Mao Tse-tung's Bar Mitzvah\r\nwas 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" Nash\r\nsuddenly regained his sanity in the late '80s and then won the 1994 Nobel\r\nMemorial Prize in economics.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                  Time and Newsweek , May 18\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nTuesday, May 12, 1998)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            The cancer hoopla allows the\r\nnewsweeklies to strike a favorite pose: pretending to preach caution while\r\nactually hyping madly. The large print on Newsweek 's cover reads \"Cancer\r\nCure,\" while Time puts a huge red X through the word \"Cancer.\" Beneath,\r\nthey run sober (and nearly identical) small print: \"The Hope and the\r\nHype--Behind the Latest Breakthroughs,\" Newsweek ; \"How to Tell the Hype\r\nFrom the Hope,\" Time . Their inside stories, too, are cautious, noting\r\nthat the new anti-angiogenic drugs are extremely promising but not a miracle\r\ncure. (Both mags rap the New York Times for its overenthusiastic\r\nendorsement.) Time runs an excellent chart of the various kinds of\r\ncancer treatments. Requisite Wall Street angle: Time says biotech stocks\r\nare undervalued; Newsweek says they're still too volatile to be reliable\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Time reports that\r\nKenneth Starr's prosecutors have been meeting secretly with Secret Service\r\nagents. Despite pressure from Starr's team, the agents refuse to discuss any\r\nspecifics about Clinton's meetings with Monica Lewinsky. ...\r\n\r\n               Time 's farewell to Seinfeld says that it 1) has a much\r\nsmaller audience than many popular sitcoms of the last generation; 2) is not\r\nthe first show \"about nothing\" ( Three's Company ); and 3) is not even the\r\nfunniest show on television ( The Simpsons ).\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Newsweek likens Apple's new iMac to the Volkswagen Beetle, saying it's\r\nboth fun and functional.

It\r\nalso explains why human trials of the drugs can't begin for at least a year:\r\nThe current total supply of the drugs is only enough to treat a few mice.\r\n... A piece describes the growing conflict between skinheads and\r\nrappers--in Moscow. Neo-Nazi skinheads, who beat up an African-American Marine\r\nlast week, hate the (slightly) more racially tolerant rappers, who imitate\r\nblack American fashion and music. ... The magazine says the Internal Revenue Service is being scapegoated for the wrong\r\nreasons. In fact, criminal tax prosecutions are decreasing .

Starr's first year as independent counsel was vigorous and\r\neffective, but he has been bogged down by Clinton's stonewalling and the decay\r\nof his own staff. Starr's original experienced deputies have been replaced by\r\nyoung lawyers with little prosecutorial experience. ... A respectful\r\nprofile of Robert Redford--pegged to his new movie, The Horse\r\nWhisperer --says he's \"wraithlike\" and private. But he is responsible for\r\n\"some of America's most defining contemporary images: the investigative\r\nreporter, the loner, the defender of the unregulated outdoors,\" etc. ...\r\nA piece says major-league pitchers are injuring their arms more frequently\r\nbecause the mound is too low, the strike zone is too small, and the rise of\r\nother sports (soccer, basketball) has diminished the supply of major leaguers\r\nwith strong arms.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               \r\n                  Weekly Standard , May 18\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               (posted\r\nTuesday, May 12, 1998)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            A long\r\nstory exposes wrongheaded sexual correctness in the military. Jackie Parker,\r\nwho sought to be the first woman to fly an F-16 in combat, complained that her\r\nNew York Air National Guard unit mistreated her, ending the careers of many of\r\nthe unit's pilots. In fact, says the Standard , Parker was unqualified to\r\nfly F-16s, was given favorable treatment by higher-ups because she was a woman,\r\ndestroyed morale by sleeping with her supervisor, and herself sexually harassed\r\nmale pilots.
