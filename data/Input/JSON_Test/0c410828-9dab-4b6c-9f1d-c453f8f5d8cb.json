When slavery ended, cotton growers had either\r\nto figure out how to harvest their crop without dirt-cheap labor, or find\r\nanother crop to grow. Many opted to grow tobacco, and it looks like it's time\r\nto switch again.\r\n\r\n            I find it\r\ninteresting that my representative in Congress, Thomas Bliley, can, with a\r\nstraight face, recommend subsidies for these farmers when he and others in his\r\nparty have vowed to get rid of \"welfare as we know it.\" Tobacco subsidies are\r\njust another form of welfare. I say give the growers two years, then make them\r\nget a job like everybody else!\r\n\r\n            -- Dina Coles Glen\r\nAllen, Va.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n               Shugerless Latte\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Slate received several\r\nletters in response to the Oct. 8 absence of \"Today's Papers,\"\r\nwhose author, Scott Shuger, had fallen ill:\r\n            \r\n\r\n            Wow!\r\nShuger withdrawals this morning.

Why did you choose two pompous, straight, white ultranerds for\r\nyour subjects? These kids aren't the stuff of excitement, controversy,\r\nprovocation! Their particular narcissism renders them incapable of viewing any\r\nsort of interesting scandal around them.\r\n\r\n            -- Jay Schwartz\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               High\r\nFrat Content\r\n            \r\n\r\n            I just wanted to make a\r\ncomment on your \"Diaries\" of Ivy League students (Bisen-Hersh and Trachtenberg) that, in your words, \"tell us what life at these top\r\nschools is really like.\" First, when you pick two guys that are basically\r\nsimilar in background and basically similar in every other way, you get two\r\ndiaries that--here comes a shocker!--sound similar. Therefore, how is two\r\nbetter than one? What kind of sample of real college life is that?\r\n\r\n            Second, speaking from\r\nexperience of being at an Ivy and being in a fraternity, there are some things\r\nthat are really missing in their diaries. It's a crime to quote that\r\nstory about the fallen teen-ager, and then bring in two guys who would have no\r\nclue about Greek life! Sure, I find it interesting to read that some people\r\nhave fun playing Boggle and touring the dorms together, but is this a good way\r\nto find an answer to a question that uses \"hotbed\" and \"sexual abandon\" in the\r\nsame sentence?\r\n\r\n            Next\r\ntime, fit your point--pick somebody in a fraternity or a sorority, or somebody\r\nthat would bring meaning to the anecdote you quoted. Be prepared to take the\r\ngood with the bad. For instance, members of Greek organizations have a higher\r\naverage GPA than regular students. Or maybe that's not what Yale or MIT wanted\r\neveryone to hear. We wouldn't want everybody to know about our games of binge\r\ndrinking, sexual abandon, and Boggle, too!\r\n\r\n            -- Brad Webber\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n               Four\r\nWeddings and an Assimilation\r\n            \r\n\r\n            There was a funny moment in\r\none of Eric Liu's responses to Elliott Abrams in their \"Dialogue\" on mixed marriage. Liu declared himself unconcerned with\r\nthe very high rate of intermarriage among Asian-Americans, and proposed that\r\nthe same easygoing attitude should work for Jews. And on the face of it, why\r\nnot? It is only when one considers numbers that the comparison becomes quite\r\nhilarious. To Abrams' concern that the (fewer than) 15-million Jews in the\r\nworld might disappear through assimilation, Liu replies with the generosity and\r\nlack of worries of one backed by a billion people. Give me a tenth of that in\r\nIsrael and I could also see it his way. Instead, in the case of Jews the depth\r\nof the mother country runs at about 4 (embattled) million.\r\n\r\n            Of course,\r\nunderlying this discussion is the deeper question of whether there is any value\r\nin the preservation of Jewish religion and culture. Those of us who believe\r\nthere is such a value are worried.\r\n\r\n            \r\n               --Sanda\r\nKaufman Cleveland\r\n\r\n            \r\n               Address your e-mail to\r\nthe editors to letters@slate.com.
