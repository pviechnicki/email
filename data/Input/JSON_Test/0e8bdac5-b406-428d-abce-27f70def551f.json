La\r\nStampa of Turin noted that Yeltsin came to Israel with an entourage of\r\n140 people and several black limousines. The Jerusalem Post noted that, despite reports of Russian\r\nmilitary setbacks in Chechnya, Yeltsin said that Russia \"will finish with the\r\n[Chechen] terrorists within a month.\" Earlier in the day, he had predicted a\r\nRussian victory in two months, but after a festive luncheon held in his honor\r\nby Israeli President Ezer Weizman, he halved the estimate. The Post said\r\nhis room in Jerusalem had been stocked with a selection of Israeli vodkas. When\r\nasked to sign a visitor's book, Yeltsin \"spent a few long minutes writing\r\nlaboriously in the volume,\" the Post said. \"But all he left for\r\nposterity in Jerusalem was his signature and the date.\" Ha'aretz , meanwhile,\r\ncontinued its campaign to persuade President Weizman to resign, after reports,\r\nwhich he has not denied, that he received nearly $500,000 in gifts from a\r\nFrench millionaire.\r\n\r\n            The\r\nIndependent\r\nof London reported allegations Thursday that the Russian apartment-block\r\nbombings that ignited the latest war in Chechnya and propelled Vladimir Putin\r\ninto the presidency were the work not of Islamic terrorists, as claimed by\r\nMoscow, but of the Russian special services. The paper's Moscow correspondent\r\nclaimed to have seen a video in which a Russian officer captured by the\r\nChechens made the allegations. Identifying himself as Alexei Galitin of the GRU\r\n(Russian military intelligence service), the bearded captive said that the\r\nexplosions last September in Moscow and Volgodonsk that killed nearly 300\r\npeople had been carried out by the GRU in collaboration with the FSB (the\r\nRussian security service). The Russian ministry of defense dismissed the video\r\nas a Chechen dirty trick. \"The Russian armed forces protect the people. It is\r\nimpossible that they would attack their own people,\" a spokesman said.\r\n\r\n            From\r\nProvidence, R.I., Sergei Khrushchev, son of the late Soviet leader Nikita\r\nKhrushchev, told the Moscow Times that he is \"scared\" by the transfer of power\r\nfrom Yeltsin to Putin. Khrushchev, a former Soviet missile engineer who became\r\nan American citizen last July, said he believes Putin launched the war in\r\nChechnya to mask the fact that he has no economic program for Russia.\r\n\r\n            The\r\nItalian papers Friday fronted what they called a snub to Pope John Paul II by\r\nChina, when it consecrated five \"patriotic\" Roman Catholic bishops in Beijing\r\nwithout his authorization. The South China Morning Post of Hong Kong described the action as a severe blow to efforts to\r\nnormalize diplomatic relations between China and the Vatican and said that \"the\r\ntiming of the ceremony at a Beijing cathedral appeared to be an open challenge\r\nto the Pope, just hours before he was due to ordain 12 new bishops from around\r\nthe world at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\" The Vatican's ties with Taiwan are\r\na major obstacle to the restoration of diplomatic relations, the paper\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n            The\r\nDaily Telegraph of London led its front page Friday with a report\r\nof an epic escape from Chinese Communist rule in Tibet by the teen-age head of\r\none of the four great sects of Tibetan Buddhism. It said the 17 th\r\nkarmapa, a 14-year-old boy, crossed the Himalayas on foot with four attendants\r\nbefore stumbling into Dharamsala, the Indian seat in exile of the Dalai Lama,\r\nWednesday. He had traveled 900 miles from his remote monastery home, 30 miles\r\nnorthwest of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. The South China Morning Post\r\ncalled his flight a \"body blow\" to Beijing, which\r\nrecognized his enthronement as a living Buddha in 1992 and was suspected of\r\nwanting to manipulate him to drive a wedge between his sect and the dominant\r\nGelugpa sect of the Dalai Lama. According to the Chinese media, the karmapa\r\nleft behind a letter saying he was going abroad \"to get the musical instruments\r\nof the Buddhist mass and the black hats that have been used by the previous\r\nliving Buddhas.\" Playing down his defection, the New China News Agency said\r\nthat he \"did not mean to betray the State, the nation, the monastery, or the\r\nleadership.\"\r\n\r\n            For\r\nthe second time this week, the Financial Times of London ran an editorial\r\ncalling for the U.S. Federal Reserve to be made more accountable to politicians\r\nand the public. Praising Alan Greenspan's record as he embarks on a fourth term\r\nas its chairman, the FT said, however, that \"the concentration of so\r\nmuch policymaking power in the hands of one individual does not constitute\r\ninternational best practice. Nor does the Fed win first prize for openness and\r\ntransparency in central banking.\" The paper led its front page, as did the\r\nNew York Times , with the inquiry into the U.S. auditing profession\r\nfollowing revelations of rampant violations of share ownership regulations by\r\npartners in PricewaterhouseCoopers, the world's biggest accounting firm.\r\n\r\n            The British tabloid the\r\nSun reported\r\n\"exclusively\" Friday that Catherine Zeta Jones, the Welsh film star, has agreed\r\nto sign a pre-nuptial agreement forgoing any claims on Michael Douglas' fortune\r\nif their marriage fails. Douglas announced Thursday on his Web site that they\r\nplan to marry sometime this year. The Sun said Zeta Jones didn't want a\r\nHollywood wedding but hoped to marry Douglas in a tiny chapel close to her\r\nchildhood home in South Wales.\r\n\r\n         \r\n      \r\n   \r\n"},"properties":[{"key":"SourceSystemId","values":["OLALC9L4T2U4.97P93JYJ1JDF@mimefactory.state.tld"]},{"key":"Sender","values":["{\"Name\":null,\"Address\":\"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev\",\"RoutingType\":\"SMTP\",\"MailboxType\":\"Mailbox\",\"Id\":null}"]},{"key":"IngestedFromMailbox","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"BirthId","values":["0e8bdac5-b406-428d-abce-27f70def551f"]},{"key":"SizeInKb","values":["12.142"]},{"key":"AttachmentCount","values":["0"]},{"key":"IsCapstone","values":["True"]},{"key":"Sensitivity","values":["Official"]},{"key":"SensitivityAssigned","values":["EnvironmentDefaultAssigned"]},{"key":"IsRecord","values":["True"]},{"key":"IsTransitory","values":["False"]},{"key":"Classification","values":[""]},{"key":"MetadataGenerated","values":["2017-11-08T12:52:31.1342321Z"]},{"key":"MetadataGeneratorVersion","values":["0.1.1107.1"]},{"key":"Source","values":["MessagePump@state.dev"]},{"key":"SourceType","values":["EmailExchange"]},{"key":"DispositionType","values":["Capstone"]},{"key":"DispositionDate","values":["2042-11-06T23:57:22Z"]}],"security":{"securityDescriptors":["RECORD","OFFICIAL","CAPSTONE","eRecords"],"signatures":[]},"users":[{"userRoles":["From"],"id":122,"originalSmtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","smtp":"svcErecMbxPusher@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":false,"firstName":"svcErecMbxPusher","userValidFrom":"2017-04-18T10:34:19.84","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\svcErecMbxPusher","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"svcErecMbxPusher","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7143","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"},{"userRoles":["To"],"id":173,"originalSmtp":"eRecJmb23Recip1@state.udev","smtp":"eRecJmb23Recip1@state.udev","name":"","smtpValidFrom":"2016-11-29T23:03:01.2","smtpValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","isState":true,"isCapstone":true,"userValidFrom":"2017-08-29T02:51:09.14","userValidTo":"9999-12-31T23:59:59.99","fqdn":"appservices.state.udev\\eRecJmb23Recip1","orgUnit":"Enterprise Services,eRecords,eRecords Service Accounts","samAccountName":"eRecJmb23Recip1","sid":"S-1-5-21-3423698062-3918280449-702950220-7190","emailHost":"state.udev","topLevelDomain":"udev"}]},"errata":[{"type":"Warning","task":"ParseJournal","field":"JournalReport","value":"","reason":"No Journal Reports for Email"}],"indexLocation":"email_capstone25yr_2017"}
